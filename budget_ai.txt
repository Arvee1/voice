Cost of living help and  a future made in Australia   |   Budget 2024–25Cost of living help and a future 
made in Australia
Easing pressures today and investing in a better future
Australia is facing an uncertain global economic environment and a changing 
world. Global challenges, high but moderating inflation and higher interest 
rates have contributed to cost-of-living pressures and slower growth. 
While many Australians remain under pressure, our economy is better placed 
than most to handle these challenges. This Government's responsible 
economic management has helped ease inflationary and budget pressures. 
Though inflation is still too high, it is now less than half its peak and almost half 
of what it was around the middle of 2022. Unemployment is near a 50-year 
low. Real wages growth has returned. Australia recorded the second strongest 
budget balance among G20 countries. And we are uniquely placed to 
maximise opportunities from changes in the global economy, including the net 
zero transformation. 
The Budget helps people under pressure today and invests in a Future Made 
in Australia. It provides responsible cost-of-living relief, helps Australians earn 
more and keep more of what they earn, and builds a stronger and more 
resilient economy. 
At the same time, the Budget forecasts a second surplus in 2023–24, 
representing the first back -to-back surplus in nearly two decades, lower 
debt every year over the forward estimates and lower inflation, which is now 
expected to be back in the RBA's target band sooner. 
This Budget responds to the challenges of today and lays the foundation for 
future prosperity by:
• easing cost-of-living pressures
• building more homes for Australians
• investing in a Future Made in Australia
• strengthening Medicare and the care economy
• broadening opportunity and advancing equality
All of which is underpinned by responsible economic management. 
This Budget strikes the right balance between keeping pressure off inflation, 
delivering cost-of-living relief, supporting sustainable economic growth and 
strengthening public finances.

Cost of living help and a future made in Australia   |   Budget 2024–25Budget at a glance
An inflation‑fighting and future‑making Budget
The Government’s responsible fiscal and economic management has 
returned the budget to surplus faster than any major advanced economy. 
Following a $22.1 billion surplus in 2022–23, a $9.3 billion surplus is now forecast 
for 2023–24 – the first back-to-back surpluses in nearly two decades. 
Through banking tax receipt upgrades and targeting a surplus in 2023–24, 
the Government is supporting monetary policy by keeping the pressure off 
inflation. In this Budget, over 96 per cent of tax upgrades are expected to be 
returned in 2023–24. 
Inflation is the primary focus of the Budget in the near term. This Budget 
continues to deliver responsible cost-of-living relief. Energy bill relief and 
rent assistance are estimated to directly reduce headline inflation by ½ of 
a percentage point in 2024–25 and are not expected to add to broader 
inflationary pressures. Treasury is forecasting this could see headline inflation 
return to the target band by the end of 2024.
The Government is stabilising and reducing gross debt as a share of the 
economy. Gross debt as a share of the economy is lower over the next 
decade than at the 2023–24 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 
(MYEFO). Gross debt is projected to peak at 35.2 per cent of GDP in 2026–27, 
9.7 percentage points lower than was forecast in 2022 Pre-Election Economic 
and Fiscal Outlook.

management
Delivering on our Economic and Fiscal Strategy
The Government's fiscal strategy strikes the right balance between getting 
inflation under control, easing cost-of-living pressures, supporting sustainable 
growth and building fiscal buffers in an uncertain global environment. 
Since the 2022 Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the Government's 
responsible fiscal management has:
• Improved the cumulative underlying cash balance by $214.7 billion, reducing 
cumulative deficits by around two thirds over the six years to 2027–28.
• Found $104.8 billion in responsible savings, spending reprioritisations and 
budget improvements.
• Returned 82 per cent of tax upgrades to the budget over the forward 
estimates, including 96 per cent in 2023–24 in this Budget.
• Lowered the projected peak in gross debt as a share of GDP from 
44.9 per cent of GDP to 35.2 per cent of GDP – lowering the peak by 
almost 10 percentage points of GDP. 
• Avoided around $80 billion in interest payments over the medium term due 
to the improvements to the Budget position. 
This Budget provides $15.4 billion to address unavoidable spending pressures 
to ensure Australians don’t see a cut to the programs and services they rely 
on. This includes extending funding of terminating health programs, myGov 
and frontline services. 
The budget continues to face long-term fiscal challenges from interest costs, 
the NDIS, defence, health, and aged care. 
The Government's responsible approach is delivering lower debt, in line with 
the Economic and Fiscal Strategy, and has returned the budget to surplus 
faster than any major advanced economy. This is building the buffers required 
to address these challenges while continuing to deliver the high-quality 
services Australians deserve.

Cost of living help and a future made in Australia   |   Budget 2024–25Global economic outlook
A weak and uncertain global economy
The global economic outlook is highly uncertain. Heightened 
geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have added to the risks associated with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, growth is slowing in China and weak elsewhere and supply chains are fragmenting.
Global growth is forecast to remain subdued over the 
next  few years and is expected to record the longest stretch 
of below average growth since the early  1990s. 
Most advanced economies recorded subdued outcomes 
during 2023, with around a third of OECD nations recording a technical recession. The United States has been the notable exception where earlier disinflation and a strong recovery in productivity have contributed to the economy consistently exceeding expectations. 
Global inflation has moderated but remains too high, and 
there are risks it will persist. Tackling inflation remains the 
primary focus but, as  inflationary pressures abate and labour 
markets soften, the global policy focus will increasingly shift to managing risks to growth.Australia, United States and China

Cost of living help and a future made in Australia   |   Budget 2024–25Domestic economic outlook
Facing challenges from a position of 
economic strength
Australia is not immune from global developments. 
Moderating but high inflation and higher interest rates here have resulted in lower growth over the past year. The Australian economy faces these challenges from a position of economic strength with inflation that is now less than half of its peak, a resilient labour market with unemployment close to 50-year lows, a return to annual real wage growth and a solid pipeline of business investment.
The Government’s targeted cost-of-living measures are 
expected to reduce inflation, with energy bill relief and Commonwealth Rent Assistance expected to directly reduce inflation by ½ of a percentage point in 2024–25 and not expected to add to broader inflationary pressures. Treasury is forecasting this could see headline inflation return to the target band by the end of 2024, slightly earlier than expected at MYEFO.
The labour market has been resilient with an unemployment 
rate near historic lows, workforce participation near its record high, and around 780,000 jobs created since May 2022. Employment is growing faster than any major advanced economy. The unemployment rate is expected to rise modestly but remain below pre-pandemic levels.
The combination of nominal wages growing at their fastest 
rate in nearly 15 years and the moderation in inflation has resulted in real wages returning to annual growth.
The pipeline of business investment remains strong and 
this growth is expected to continue through to 2025–26. 
If realised, this would be the longest sustained increase in 
investment since the mining boom. 
Real GDP is expected to grow by 1¾ per cent in 2023–24 and 
remain subdued over the period ahead. Real GDP is forecast to grow by 2 per cent in 2024–25 and 2¼ per cent in 2025–26. Moderating inflation, higher wage growth, continuing employment growth and the Government’s cost-of-living tax cuts should support a recovery in household consumption.Real GDP growth

Australians keeping more of what they earn 
The Government is delivering tax cuts for all 13.6 million Australian taxpayers 
from 1 July 2024 to ease cost-of-living pressures for middle Australia, return bracket creep, support women and boost labour supply. 
From 1 July this year, the Government will: 
• Reduce the 19 per  cent tax rate to 16 per  cent
• Reduce the 32.5 per  cent tax rate to 30 per  cent
• Increase the income threshold above which the 37 per  cent tax rate 
applies  from $120,000 to $135,000
• Increase the income threshold above which the 45 per  cent tax rate 
applies  from $180,000 to $190,000.

The Government's tax cuts return bracket creep and lower 
average tax rates for all taxpayers. The changes provide taxpayers with greater protection against bracket creep, particularly low- to middle-income taxpayers, and support the progressivity of the tax system. 
Boosting labour supply with more benefits for women
The tax cuts will ensure Australians keep more of what they earn. Increases in take-home pay will reduce disincentives for Australians to take on more hours of work. The tax cuts are expected to increase labour supply by 930,000 hours per week, equivalent to around 25,000 full-time jobs. This increase is driven by women and individuals in the low- to middle-income range, particularly those earning between $25,000 and $75,000. 
All 6.5 million women taxpayers will receive a tax cut in 
2024–25, with an average benefit of around $1,650. This 
will increase the financial return from work and  support 
participation.

Increasing the Medicare levy low-income thresholds
The Government has increased the Medicare levy

Cost of living help and a future made in Australia   |   Budget 2024–25New power bill relief 
Providing $300 energy rebates to every 
Australian household 
The Government is providing $3.5 billion in energy bill relief 
for all Australian households and around one million small 
businesses. From 1 July 2024, more than 10 million households 
will receive a total rebate of $300 and eligible small 
businesses will receive $325 on their electricity bills throughout 
the year. This is estimated to directly reduce headline inflation 
by around 1/2 of a percentage point in 2024–25 and is not 
expected to add to broader inflationary pressures.
The Government's current Energy Bill Relief Plan has 
moderated electricity price increases. Prices increased by just 
2 per cent through the year to the March quarter this year. 
Had this relief not been provided they would have increased 
by 14.9 per cent. This Budget recognises that households and 
small businesses remain under pressure, and extends and 
expands that relief.
Wholesale electricity prices in the National Electricity Market 
have fallen 8 per cent in the first quarter of 2024 compared 
to the same time last year, as more cheap, renewable 
generation is rolled out to deliver the Government's 
82 per cent renewable energy target.

Further boosting Commonwealth Rent 
Assistance for nearly 1 million households  
The Government is providing $1.9 billion over five years to 
increase maximum rates of Commonwealth Rent Assistance 
by a further 10 per cent. This builds on the 15 per cent 
increase in September 2023 and will take maximum rates 
over 40 per cent higher than in May 2022 – a combined 
result of indexation and the actions of our Government. 
This is the first back-to-back increase in the maximum rates 
of Commonwealth Rent Assistance outside of indexation 
changes in three decades.
For single parents or couples with one or two children the 
maximum rate of Rent Assistance has increased by over $70 
per fortnight since May 2022.
The Government's boost to Commonwealth Rent Assistance 
in last budget directly put downward pressure on rents. Rents 
increased 7.8 per cent through the year to the March quarter 
this year. Had the Government not boosted Commonwealth 
Rent Assistance, they would have risen by 9.5 per cent.Gillian is a sole parent of a

Safeguarding health outcomes
Access to affordable medicines is critical to support good health outcomes 
for Australians. The Government is working to finalise the new Eighth 
Community Pharmacy Agreement, supported by up to an additional $3  billion 
in funding, which will deliver cheaper medicines, improve patient health outcomes and secure a strong community pharmacy sector.
As part of the Agreement, instead of rising with inflation, there will be a 
one-year freeze on the maximum Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) patient co-payment for everyone with a Medicare card and a five-year freeze for pensioners and other concession cardholders.
Around six out of ten prescriptions on the PBS are issued to pensioners 
and other concession cardholders. This change means that no pensioner or concession card holder will pay more than $7.70 (plus any applicable manufacturer premiums) for up to five years, even as the aged pension and social security payments rise in line with inflation.$7.70

Debt relief for students
The Government will cut $3 billion in student debt for more 
than 3 million Australians. This will provide relief for everyone 
with Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) and other student 
loan debt, while continuing to protect the integrity and value 
of the student loan system which has massively expanded 
access to tertiary education.
In response to the Australian Universities Accord, the 
Government will cap the HELP indexation rate to be the lower 
of either the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the Wage Price 
Index (WPI). The Government will backdate this relief to all 
HELP, VET Student Loan, Australian Apprenticeship Support 
Loan and other student support loan accounts that existed 
on 1 June 2023.
This will benefit all Australians with a HELP debt, fix last year’s 
spike and prevent growth in debt from outpacing wages in 
the future.Changing the calculation of HELP 
indexation applied from 1 June 2023 
means that the indexation rate 
is reduced from 7 �1 per cent to 
3�2 per cent in 2023 and from 
4�7 per cent to around 4 per cent in 
2024 �
Julian had a HELP debt of $26,500 
in 2023, which was the average 
outstanding HELP loan � Following 
the Government's changes in 
calculation he will receive a credit 
to his HELP account of $1,190 across 
the 2023 and 2024 years, subject to 
the passage of legislation � Over the 
life of his loan, Julian's debt would 
be reduced by around $1,600 �
Based on expectations of WPI in the 
March 2024 quarter. 
Easing cost-of-living pressures  17 
Cost of living help and a future made in Australia   |   Budget 2024–25A fair go for consumers 
Better outcomes at the checkout
The cost of essential food and grocery items is placing significant pressure 
on family budgets. 
The Government is acting to secure fairer prices, with measures to help 
Australians with the cost of living and keep the pressure off into the future.
The Government is examining pricing and competition in 
the supermarket sector �
In January, the Government appointed Dr Craig Emerson to review the 
Food and Grocery Code. Dr Emerson's interim report, released in April 2024, 
recommended the Code be made mandatory with penalties of up to 
10 per cent of turnover for major breaches, to improve supplier outcomes.
In February, the Government directed the Australian Competition and 
Consumer Commission to undertake a 12-month inquiry to investigate pricing 
and competition in the supermarket sector to ensure Australians are paying a 
fair price for their groceries.
The Government has also funded CHOICE for three years to produce quarterly 
price comparison reports to empower Australian consumers to make informed 
choices about food and grocery purchases. The first report will be released at 
the end of June.
Harnessing the energy transition for consumers
The Government has committed $27.7 million to develop priority reforms to 
ensure that consumer energy resources, including rooftop solar, household 
batteries, and electric vehicles, continue to unlock savings and benefits for 
all energy customers. 
The Government has also committed $1.8 million to support a range of energy 
retail market reforms, including enabling consumers to switch to a better deal 
with just ‘one click,’ preventing contracts rolling over to higher-cost deals, 
ensuring people receive the concessions and rebates they are entitled to, 
and reducing excess fees and charges.$1.1m

Cost of living help and a future made in Australia   |   Budget 2024–25Growing wages
Standing up for low ‑paid workers
The Government's efforts to get wages moving and bring down inflation 
has contributed to three consecutive quarters of real wage growth for the 
first time in more than five years, supporting a return to annual real wage 
growth sooner than expected. The Government's continued focus on gender 
equality has led to the Fair Work Commission undertaking research to 
identify occupations and industries with gender pay inequity and potential 
undervaluation of work.
The Government has backed real wage growth for low-paid workers in each 
of the last three Annual Wage Reviews. Record increases were delivered for 
award wage workers in 2022 and 2023, with full-time workers on the National 
Minimum Wage earning $110 more a week than when the Government came 
to office.
The Government has committed to funding the Fair Work Commission 
decision to increase award wages for aged care workers, building on 
the $11.3 billion already allocated for the interim 15 per cent increase. 
The Government has also committed to provide funding towards a wage 
increase for the early childhood education and care workforce, with details to 
be finalised following the Fair Work Commission processes currently underway.   
Enhancing services and supports
Financial wellbeing and capability 
Support will be boosted for Australians facing acute and urgent financial 
pressures with $138 million to meet sustained high demand for crisis support 
including emergency relief, food relief and financial support services. 
Freezing social security deeming rates 
Social security recipients will be supported to manage their budgets 
by continuing the freeze on social security deeming rates for financial 
investments at their current levels until 30 June 2025. This benefits around 
876,000 income support recipients, including 450,000 Age Pensioners. 
Paid placements for nurses, teachers and social workers

Addressing housing pressures
The Government has an ambitious and comprehensive housing plan aimed 
at easing housing shortages and affordability pressures faced across the 
country by:
• building more homes sooner
• providing more support for renters
• providing a pathway to home ownership for low-income Australians. 
This Budget invests a further $6.2 billion in specific initiatives, taking the 
Government's total new investment since 2022 to $32 billion. Existing 
investment has been made to directly increase the supply of social and 
affordable housing, delivering 40,000 social and affordable homes through 
the National Housing Accord and the Housing Australia Future Fund. This 
is in addition to providing $2 billion to the states and territories to deliver 
around 4,000 new and refurbished social homes through the Social Housing 
Accelerator.  
Supporting  more homes
The Government is making available a further $1 billion to states and territories 
to deliver new housing – including for connecting essential services such as 
water, power, sewerage and roads. This investment expands on the $500 
million already committed through the Housing Support Program to support 
enabling infrastructure to unlock more homes. 
More help for renters
A $1.9 billion investment will increase the maximum rates of Commonwealth 
Rent Assistance by a further 10 per cent to further alleviate rental stress. This 
builds on the 15 per cent increase already made in September 2023, taking 
the increase to Commonwealth Rent Assistance maximum rates to over 
40 per cent since May 2022 including indexation. 
More housing for students
To deliver more accommodation for students and to reduce pressure on the 
private rental market, the Government will work with the higher education 
sector to develop regulations that will require universities to increase their 
supply of student accommodation. $6.2

Cost of living help and a future made in Australia   |   Budget 2024–25More housing support for vulnerable Australians
The Budget includes funding for a new five-year, $9.3 billion National 
Agreement on Social Housing and Homelessness with states and territories. 
This represents an increase of $423 million. Under the agreement, the 
Commonwealth will double its dedicated funding for homelessness services to 
$400 million a year – funding that states and territories must match. 
The Government is targeting the $1 billion increase to the National Housing 
Infrastructure Facility to better support housing for women and children 
experiencing domestic violence and for youth. The funding is being 
rebalanced to provide more up-front grants to support states and territories 
and community housing providers to deliver more housing for these cohorts. 
Other measures to support housing
The Government is: 
• Providing $88.8 million for 20,000 new fee-free TAFE places, including 
increased access to pre-apprenticeship programs, in courses relevant to the 
construction sector.
• Providing an additional $1.9 billion in concessional loans to community 
housing providers and other charities to support delivery of new social and 
affordable homes under the Housing Australia Future Fund and National 
Housing Accord. 
• Making a landmark $4 billion joint investment with the Northern Territory 
Government to improve conditions and address overcrowding in remote 
housing in the Northern Territory. 
• Allowing foreign investors to purchase established Build to Rent 
developments with a lower foreign investment fee, conditional on the 
property continuing to be operated as a Build to Rent development.

key industries
Making Australians the beneficiaries of change
A Future Made in Australia is about creating new jobs and opportunities for 
every part of our country by maximising the economic and industrial benefits 
of the move to net zero and securing Australia’s place in a changing global 
economic and strategic landscape.
The Government’s $22.7 billion Future Made in Australia package will 
help facilitate the private sector investment required for Australia to be 
an indispensable part of the global economy. It recognises the best 
opportunities for Australia are at the intersection of industry, clean energy, 
resources and human capital. It builds a stronger, more diversified and resilient 
economy powered by clean energy, in a way that creates secure, well-paid 
jobs in our regions and suburbs; and invests in the people, communities and 
services that will drive success. 
Better deploying capital in priority areas
The Future Made in Australia package will realise Australia's potential to 
become a renewable energy superpower, value-add to our resources and 
strengthen economic security by better attracting and enabling investment in 
priority areas. The Government will create a Future Made in Australia Act and 
establish a National Interest Framework that identifies priority industries and 
ensures investments associated with them are responsible and targeted. 
The Framework will have a focus on industries that contribute to the net zero 
transformation where Australia has a comparative advantage, and where 
Australia has national interest imperatives related to economic resilience 
and security. It will also allow for the setting of new Community Benefit 
Principles to ensure government investment has flow-on benefits for the 
broader community, and will complement the Buy Australian Plan and Secure 
Australian Jobs Code.
The Future Made in Australia package is complemented by broader 
government priorities and initiatives in this Budget, which help make our 
economy stronger and more resilient. These include investments in education, 
defence capabilities, trade and regional engagement and support for small 
business, farmers and regions.
30 Investing in a Future Made in Australia
Cost of living help and a future made in Australia   |   Budget 2024–25Strengthening and streamlining approvals 
The Government is making it easier to invest in transformational projects 
by streamlining approval processes in ways that strengthen standards. 
Through smarter use of data, better decision-making processes and 
appropriate resourcing, this Budget provides a faster pathway to better 
decisions on environmental, energy, planning, cultural heritage and foreign 
investment approvals.
This includes:
• $134.2 million to better prioritise approvals for renewable energy projects of 
national significance, and support faster decisions on environment, cultural 
heritage and planning approvals. 
• Working with the states and territories through the Energy and Climate 
Change Ministerial Council to accelerate electricity grid connections, 
delivering an additional 3.2 gigawatts of capacity so far. 
• $20.7 million to improve engagement with communities impacted by the 
energy transition and accelerate the delivery of key energy projects, 
through a bolstered Australian Energy Infrastructure Commissioner and 
voluntary national developer standards. 
• $15.7 million to strengthen scrutiny of high-risk foreign investment proposals, 
enhance monitoring and enforcement activities and support faster decisions. 
The Government's stronger, more streamlined and more transparent approach 
to foreign investment aims to attract the significant foreign capital flows that 
Australia needs. The Government will also encourage foreign investment 
by providing refunds of 75 per cent of application fees for unsuccessful 
competitive bids. 
Promoting sustainable finance
The Government is committing $17.3 million to mobilise private sector 
investment in sustainable activities. This includes extending Australia's 
sustainable finance taxonomy to the agriculture sector and developing 
a labelling regime for financial products marketed as sustainable. The 
Government will also examine opportunities to improve data quality and 
provide $1.3 million to develop and issue guidance for best practice transition 
plans. This builds on the Government's climate disclosure legislation and the 
issuance of around $7 billion of sovereign green bonds in 2023–24. $134.2

Powering Australia with cheaper, cleaner, more reliable energy
Australia's potential to produce abundant renewable energy is a powerful 
source of comparative advantage. To realise this, the Government is unlocking more than $65 billion of investment in renewable capacity through the Capacity Investment Scheme by 2030. 
This Budget helps Australians benefit from cheaper, cleaner energy sooner by 
investing $27.7 million to integrate consumer energy resources like batteries and solar into the grid. 
The New Vehicle Efficiency Standard will save Australians around $95 billion at 
the bowser by 2050 and reduce transport emissions. 
Unlocking investment in net zero industries and jobs
The Government is creating new jobs and opportunities for all by maximising the economic and industrial benefits of the transition. This Budget accelerates growth of new industries by establishing the $1.7 billion Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund and delivering a 10-year extension of funding to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. It also delivers the $44.4 million Energy Industry Jobs Plan and $134.2 million for skills and employment support in key regions. 
The Future Made in Australia package establishes time-limited incentives 
to invest in new industries. The Hydrogen Production Tax Incentive will make Australia's pipeline of hydrogen projects commercial sooner, at an estimated cost of $6.7 billion over the decade. This Budget also expands the Hydrogen Headstart program by $1.3 billion, supporting early movers to invest in the industry's development. 
Green metals and low-carbon liquid fuels are also key to the net zero 
transformation, and this Budget supports consultation to accelerate investment and incentivise efficient production in these sectors. 
These complement incentives that build economic resilience, including the 
10 per cent production tax incentive for the processing and refining of critical 
minerals, and  investments in clean energy technology supply chains.$8

accelerate investment in renewable hydrogen
32 Investing in a Future Made in Australia
Cost of living help and a future made in Australia   |   Budget 2024–25Boosting demand for Australia's green exports
The Government is making it easier for businesses and trading partners 
to source low-emissions products by building better markets and product 
standards for green products. 
This Budget provides $32.2 million to fast-track the initial phase of the 
Guarantee of Origin scheme, focused on renewable hydrogen, and bring 
forward the expansion of the scheme to accredit the emissions content of 
green metals and low-carbon liquid fuels. The Government is also working 
closely with trading partners to identify opportunities to drive greater supply 
chain transparency and better market recognition of high environmental, 
social and governance standards in the critical minerals sector.
Realising the opportunities of the net zero transformation
Australia is committed to reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions 
by 2050 and is developing six sector plans covering electricity and energy, 
transport, industry, resources, agriculture and land, and the built environment.  
This Budget continues the Government's investment in effective emissions 
abatement, including through $63.8 million to support emissions reduction 
efforts in the agriculture and land sector. 
The Government is also investing $399 million to establish the Net Zero 
Economy Authority and support the economy-wide net zero transformation 
that is underway by acting as a catalyst for private and public investment, 
major project development, employment transition and skills and community 
development. This Budget also strengthens community engagement in 
and benefits from the transition by investing an additional $48 million in the 
reforms to the Australian Carbon Credit Unit scheme and $20.7 million to 
improve community engagement and realise community benefits for regional 
communities affected by the energy transition.$95

Backing a strong resources sector 
The Government is investing $8.8 billion over the decade to add more value 
to our resources and strengthen critical minerals supply chains. This Budget establishes a production tax incentive for processing and refining of critical minerals at an estimated cost of $7 billion over the decade. It also commits up to $1.2 billion in strategic critical minerals projects through the Critical Minerals Facility and the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, and in pre-feasibility studies for common user precincts. This is in addition to $566.1 million to support Geoscience Australia to map all of Australia's critical minerals, strategic materials, groundwater and other resources essential for the transition to net zero.
Manufacturing clean energy technologies
The Government is also committing $1.5 billion to manufacturing of clean 
energy technologies, including the $1 billion Solar Sunshot and $523.2  million 
Battery Breakthrough Initiative. These investments will be delivered by ARENA and help scale Australian innovations and strengthen supply chain resilience.
Strengthening supply chains 
To support the delivery of the 82 per cent renewable energy target, the Government has formed the National Renewable Energy Supply Chain Action Plan with states and territories. The Government will also invest an additional $14.3 million to improve the competitiveness of the Australian economy by working with trade partners to support global rules on unfair trade practices and to negotiate benchmarks for trade in high quality critical minerals.

education
The Government is committing $1.6 billion over 5 years, and an 
additional $2.7 billion from 2028–29 to 2034–35 to reform our tertiary education system and deliver our future workforce. 
This includes $1.1 billion for landmark reforms to university 
funding and tertiary system governance, which will drive higher levels of attainment, broaden access and support a more integrated tertiary education system that is responsive and adaptable to skills needs. 
The Budget also invests to deliver on immediate skills needs, 
providing over $500 million for skills and training in priority industries and to support women's participation in these sectors.
The investments will help more people take advantage of the 
opportunities that come with higher education. Attaining a bachelor degree is estimated to increase lifetime earnings by 60 per cent relative to having a highest level of education of 
year  11 or below. 
The Government will set a tertiary 
attainment target of 80 per  cent of the 
working-age population to have a tertiary 
qualification by 2050 � 
Supporting students on placements
The Government will establish Commonwealth Prac Payments (CPP) for students undertaking mandatory placements. From 1 July 2025, the payment will provide more than 73,000 eligible students, including teachers, nurses, midwives and social workers with $319.50 per week during their placements.
Broadening access to university 
To drive growth in tertiary participation, the Government 
will reform the university funding model. From January  2026, 
needs-based funding will provide per student funding contributions for under-represented students. The Government will also provide $350.3 million to fully fund university enabling courses and increase pathways for prospective students to university. Felicity is a full-time student

Skills and training for Future Made in Australia industries
The Government will expand eligibility to the New Energy Apprenticeships 
Program to include apprentices with exposure to work in clean energy, 
including in construction and advanced manufacturing. This will provide 
access to $10,000 incentive payments and support our target of 10,000 new 
energy apprentices. 
To further support renewable energy superpower ambitions, the Government 
will commit $30 million to turbocharge the VET teaching workforce for clean 
energy courses and $50 million to support clean energy training facility 
upgrades and expansion.
Delivering the skills for a Future Made in Australia will require more women 
working in male-dominated sectors. The Government will invest $55.6 million

Building a better system
The Government is investing $2.8 billion to continue its 
commitment to strengthen Medicare. This includes the 
$1.2 billion package to address pressures facing the health 
system, which provides:
• $882.2 million to support older Australians avoid hospital 
admission, be discharged from hospital earlier and improve 
their transition out of hospital to other appropriate care. 
• $227 million to deliver a further 29 Medicare Urgent Care 
Clinics and boost support for regional and remote clinics. 
This will increase the total number of clinics across Australia 
to 87. Since commencing last year, existing clinics have 
already provided almost 400,000 bulk billed visits.  
• $90 million to address health workforce shortages by 
making it simpler and quicker for international health 
practitioners to work in Australia.
Improving health outcomes
Almost half of Australians live with a chronic condition. This 
Budget will provide $141.1 million for research and services for 
people living with chronic conditions, including bowel and 
skin cancer, diabetes and dementia.
To improve health outcomes, the Government is also providing:

$1.6 billion over 13 years) through the Medical Research Future Fund to 
continue existing research missions and to introduce two new research 
missions for low-survival cancers and reducing health inequities.
Improving access to medicines
• The Government is investing $3.4 billion for new and amended listings to the 
PBS providing eligible patients with significant savings on treatment costs.
• By expanding the Closing the Gap PBS Co-payment Program, eligible 
First Nations patients will have free or cheaper access to all PBS medicines.
• Australians will benefit from $141.1 million being provided to support and 
expand the National Immunisation Program. 
Mental health support 
Almost half of Australians will experience a mental health concern in their 
lifetime. The Government is committed to creating a system where Australians 
can access quality and affordable care when and where they need it. 
This Budget continues this commitment by strengthening the mental health 
system and responding to recommendations made in the independent 
evaluation of the Better Access initiative, which provides Medicare-subsidised 
treatment services. 
The Government's $888.1 million mental health package over eight years will 
help people get the care they need, while relieving pressure on the Better 
Access initiative and making it easier to access services.
To address the gap for people with mild mental health concerns, a new 
national, free low-intensity digital service will be established. From 1 January 
2026, every Australian will be able to access this free service without a referral, 
providing timely, high quality mental health support. Once fully established, 
150,000 people are expected to make use of this service each year.
The Government is also improving access to free mental health services through a 
network of walk-in Medicare Mental Health Centres, built on the established Head 
to Health network. The upgraded national network of 61 Medicare Mental Health 
Centres will be open by 30 June 2026. They will provide clinical services for adults 
with moderate to severe mental health needs.

quality care they need in the later years of their lives. This Budget provides 
$2.2 billion to deliver key aged care reforms and to continue to implement 
recommendations from the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and 
Safety.
The Government's new Aged Care Act will put the rights and needs of older 
people at the centre of the aged care system. The new Act will provide the 
framework for fundamental change within the aged care sector. 
The Government has already delivered priority reforms to improve quality of 
life for older Australians in aged care including:
• 24/7 nurses on-site in aged care homes 
• Ensuring providers deliver a sector average of 200 care minutes per resident 
per day
• Introducing star ratings to assist older Australians to make informed choices
• Increasing transparency in how providers manage their money through 
Dollars to Care.

Most Australians want to be able to age in place and remain in their homes as 
long as they are able. To support older Australians the Government is investing 
$531.4 million to release an additional 24,100 Home Care Packages in 2024–25 
to reduce average wait times and to support people to age at home if that is 
their preference.
Improving aged care 
The Government wants an aged care system that Australians can trust and 
have confidence in. The Government is providing funding of $110.9 million over 
4 years to increase the regulatory capability of the Aged Care Quality and 
Safety Commission. 
The Government is investing $1.2 billion in critical digital systems to support the 
introduction of the new Aged Care Act and deliver a contemporary IT system. 
The Government is providing $37 million for the My Aged Care Contact Centre 
to reduce wait times for people seeking information and access to aged care.
Higher wages for aged care workers
The Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety found that higher 
wages in aged care are necessary for staff attraction and high-quality care. 
To support fair wages for care workers, the Government has committed to 
fund the Fair Work Commission decision to increase the award wage for direct 
and indirect aged care workers once the final determination is made. This will 
build on the $11.3 billion already allocated to support the interim 15 per cent 
wage increase for aged care workers.
The Government is also providing $87.2 million for workforce initiatives to 
attract nurses and other workers into aged care.

Better and more sustainable services
Getting the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) back on track 
The Government is committed to improving outcomes for NDIS participants 
and ensuring every dollar of NDIS funding goes to those who need it most.
In this Budget, the Government is providing a further $468.7 million to 
support people with disability and get the NDIS back on track. Key 
investments include:
• $214 million over two years to fight fraud and to co-design NDIS reforms with 
people with disability, announced earlier this year
• $160.7 million to upgrade the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission's 
information technology
• $45.5 million to establish a NDIS Evidence Advisory Committee
• $20 million to start consultation and design on reforms to help NDIS 
participants and people with disability navigate services.
This builds on $732.9 million provided in the 2023–24 Budget.
On 27 March 2024 the Government introduced the Getting the NDIS Back on 
Track Bill to Parliament. The Government’s legislative reforms are aimed at 
getting the scheme back on track and securing its future.
In December 2023, National Cabinet agreed to work together to improve the 
experience of participants and restore the original intent of the Scheme to 
support people with permanent and significant disability, within a broader 
ecosystem of supports. This builds on an earlier decision by National Cabinet 
to ensure Scheme sustainability and achieve an 8 per cent growth target by 
1 July 2026, with further moderation as the NDIS matures.
Improving employment for people with disability 
$227.6 million will be invested in a new specialised disability employment 
program to replace the existing Disability Employment Services program 
by 1 July 2025. This includes investing in a modern digital platform to deliver 
better supports to providers and participants. These reforms will support more 
people with disability into sustainable work, through a program with greater 
flexibility, increased individual supports, and better service quality. Eligibility 
will also be expanded to include volunteers outside the income support 
system and those with less than eight hours per week work capacity.$160.7

In this Budget $1.8 billion will be provided to support the delivery of customer 
and payment services. This includes funding for frontline and service delivery 
staff to manage claims, respond to natural disasters and improve the cyber 
security environment. The Government is also providing $314.1 million over two 
years to significantly strengthen safety and security at Services Australia centres.
To ensure that the millions of Australian myGov accounts remain contemporary, 
secure, and fit -for-purpose, the Government is investing $580.3 million over 
4 years and $139.6 million per year ongoing to sustain the myGov platform 
and identify potential enhancements. A further $50 million will also improve 
the usability, safety and security of the myGov platform and ensure Services 
Australia can support people to protect their information and privacy. 
Strengthening the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) against fraud 
$187.4 million is being provided to better protect taxpayer data and 
Commonwealth revenue against fraudulent attacks on the tax and 
superannuation systems. Funding will upgrade the ATO's information and 
communications technologies and increase their fraud prevention capabilities. 
This will ensure the ATO has dedicated resources to manage increasing risk, 
prevent revenue loss, and support victims of fraud and cyber crime. 
Looking after our veterans
Veterans' claims processing remains an important priority for the Government 
with an additional $186 million investment for staffing resources and 
$8.4 million to improve case management and protect against cyber risk. 
Having successfully eliminated the claims backlog in early 2024, these 
investments will ensure claims processing continues to be appropriately 
resourced now and systems are improved into the future. The Government will 
provide $222 million to harmonise veterans' compensation and rehabilitation 
legislation, creating a simpler system so veterans and their families can more 
easily get the support they are entitled to.
A further $48.4 million will be available for Veterans’ Home Care 
and Community Nursing programs and $10.2 million to provide access to 
funded medical treatment for ill and injured veterans while their claims for 
liability are processed.

The Government is investing $925.2 million over 5 years from 2023–24 to provide 
support for victim-survivors leaving a violent intimate partner relationship 
including support for migrants, regardless of their visa status. This includes 
continuing existing trials until mid–2025 and then establishing the permanent 
Leaving Violence Program.
Under the new program, victim-survivors can access up to $5,000 in financial 
support, which will be indexed annually to ensure the payment meets the 
rising cost of living. Additional support services will also be available through 
the program including safety planning, risk assessment and referrals to other 
services for up to 12 weeks.
Addressing gender-based violence in higher education
The Government is committed to strengthening accountability for systemic 
gender-based violence issues in higher education by:
• establishing an independent National Student Ombudsman to investigate 
student complaints and help to resolve disputes with universities
• introducing a National Higher Education Code to Prevent and Respond to 
Gender-based Violence.
These investments, alongside additional efforts to prevent and respond 
to gender-based violence in this Budget, form part of the Government's 
$3.4 billion total investment for women's safety and to support the National 
Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children 2022–2032. This is

A Strategy for Gender Equality will drive Government action 
on women's safety, sharing and valuing care, economic 
equality, women's health and women's leadership,

Women, the Government will deliver a regular survey to hear 
directly from women about their concerns and priorities for 
gender equality.
Addressing industry gender segregation, tax cuts, and the 
new Commonwealth Prac Payment are among the measures 
in this Budget that help implement Working for Women.
Taking pressure off parents
The Government is recognising the important contribution 
parents make to society by paying superannuation on 
Government-funded Paid Parental Leave (PPL) for parents 
of babies born or adopted on or after 1 July 2025. The 
Government will provide $1.1 billion over the forward estimates, 
with payments being made annually to individuals’ super 
funds from 1 July 2026. This will reduce the impact of career 
breaks to care for young children on superannuation balances 
and support parents to achieve a more dignified retirement. 
This initiative builds on the Government's $1.2 billion investment 
from 2022–23 to 2026–27 to enhance the PPL scheme which 
will expand by two weeks each year from 1 July 2024 to reach 
a total of 26 weeks by 1 July 2026.Courtney earns around $70,000 
per year and takes 22 weeks of PPL 
after her child is born in July 2026, 
while her partner takes four weeks 
of PPL � Based on projected future 
payment rates, Courtney's family 
will receive around an additional 
$5,790 of Parental Leave Pay due to 
the expansion of the PPL scheme to 
a total of 26 weeks by 1 July 2026 �  
Both partners are also entitled 
to superannuation on their PPL

projects that support community development and create local economic 
opportunities. This $777.4 million investment is the first step to replace the 
Community Development Program with real jobs, proper wages, and decent 
conditions. The Government also intends to enhance Indigenous Business 
Australia’s ability to leverage their capital, enabling greater investment in First 
Nations housing, communities and businesses.

The Government is extending eligibility for the existing higher rate of JobSeeker Payment to single recipients with an assessed partial capacity to work between zero and 
14 hours  per week. 
Combined with a higher rate of Energy Supplement, eligible recipients will receive an increase to their rate of payment of at least $54.90 per fortnight. The base rate of payment will also be indexed to help keep pace with increases in the 
cost of living. 
Embedding and enhancing place-based approaches
The Government's $100 million Outcomes Fund will be established from 2024–25 to fund projects that support communities experiencing entrenched disadvantage. 
The Fund will focus on three areas: improving outcomes for 
children and families; helping those experiencing barriers to employment; and improving access to services for people facing or experiencing homelessness. Payments will be made in return for projects achieving agreed, measurable outcomes. 
This Budget continues to invest in place-based strategies 
across a range of policy areas, including as part of the net zero transition. The Government will provide $134.2 million for skills and employment support in key regions. This includes developing Regional Workforce Transition Plans, negotiated with governments and reflecting the voices of communities, workers, employers and unions, that will support the delivery of place-based services and supports.Anika is 45 years old and rents

Statement 1: Bud get Overview   |  Page 1 Statement 1  
Budget Overview  
The 2024 –25 Budget delivers cost -of-living help and builds a future made in Australia. 
It helps ease the pressures people are under today, invests in a stronger and more resilient 
economy and continues the  Government ’s record of responsible economic management.  
Global uncertainty, high but moderating inflation, and higher interest rates are contributing 
to cost -of-living pressures and combining to slow the economy.  At the same time, the 
global transformation  to net zero and rapid shifts in the geostrategic landscape are creating 
new opportunities and challenges for Australia ’s economic prosperity and security.  
While many Australians remain under pressure, Australia is better placed than most 
economies to mana ge these challenges and become the beneficiaries of change.  This Budget 
strikes the right balance between keeping pressure off inflation , delivering cost-of-living 
relief , supporting sustainable economic growth  and strengthening public finances.   
Following a surplus in 2022 –23, a second  is expected in 2023 –24, which would be  the first 
back -to-back  surplus es in nearly two decades . The Budget forecasts lower gross 
debt -to-GDP  and lower inflation, which  is expected to return to the RBA ’s target band 
earlier than previously expected.  
This Budget responds to the challenges of today and lays the foundation for  future  
prosperity  by: 
• easing  cost-of-living  pressures  
• building more homes for Australians  
• investing in a Future Made in Australia  
• strengthening Medicare and the care economy  
• broadening opportunity  and advancing equality . 
Global growth is expected to remain subdued over the next few years as the effects of high 
inflation, restrictive macroeconomic policies, geopolitical tensions, and challenges in the 
Chinese economy weigh on the outlook. Tackling inflation remains the primary focus but, 
as inflationary pressures abate and labour markets soften, the global policy focus will 
increasingly shift to managing risks to growth.   
Inflation rem ains elevated , but has moderated to less than half of its peak in 2022. Annual 
inflation has moderated more quickly than forecast at the 2023 –24 Mid -Year Economic and 
Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) and is expected to be lower in 2023 –24. The Government’s 
responsible cost -of-living relief measures of energy bill relief and Commonwealth Rent 
Assistance are estimated to directly reduce headline inflation by ½ of a percentage point in   |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 2  |  Statement 1: Budget Overview  
2024 –25 and are not expected to add to broader inflationary pre ssures.  This could see 
headline inflation return to the RBA ’s target band by the end of 2024, slightly earlier than 
expected at MYEFO.  
The labour market has been resilient,  with employment growing faster than many other 
advanced economies , the unemployment rate near its 50-year  historical low , nominal 
wages growing at their its fastest rate in nearly 15 years and real wages now growing .  
The Government delivered a $22.1  billion  surplus in 2022 –23. A second surplus of 
$9.3 billion  (0.3 per cent of GDP) is expected  in 2023 –24, an improvement of $ 10.5 billion  
since MYEFO . The back -to-back surpluses reflect the Government ’s discipline to return 
96 per cent of tax upgrades to Budget in 2023 –24 and 82 per cent of tax upgrades since the 
Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2022 (PEFO) over the forward estimates period.  
A deficit of $ 28.3 billion  is forecast in 2024 –25. Over the six  year s to 2027 –28, the underlying 
cash balance is stronger in every year compared to PEFO and has improved by a 
cumulative $214.7  billion . Gross debt as a share of the economy is projected to be lower 
than MYEFO in every year of the forward estimates and medium term.    
This Budget delivers further cost-of-living relief,  with  tax cuts to all 13.6  million  taxpayers. 
The Government ’s tax changes deliver bigger tax cuts for low - and middle -income 
Australians  in a way that does not add to the inflation outlook.  The Budget also provides 
energy bill relief for all households,  further increases to Commonwealth Rent Assistance,  
financial support for students  and cheaper medicines.   
The Government is taking action to build more homes for Australians. This Budget delivers 
more housi ng, provides additional funding for social housing and homelessness,  and helps 
address infrastructure bottlenecks to support the building of more homes.  It also invests in 
better transport in growth areas, including Western Sydney and South East Queensland.  
This Budget invests in a stronger and more resilient economy by building a future made in 
Australia.  It reforms investment settings and approvals,  and accelerates Australia ’s plan to 
become a renewable energy superpower by unlocking private inv estment in the production 
of hydrogen, critical minerals, and clean manufacturing.  It invests in digital and defence 
priorities,  supports small business and boosts engagement and trade in our region.  
This Budget will reform higher education to expand acces s and deliver the highly skilled 
workforce of the future. It invests in skills in priority industries and creates a more 
integrated tertiary education system that responds and adapts to skills needs.   
The Government is  invest ing in strengthening Medicare  and providing  cheaper and more 
accessible health care, including Medicare Urgent Care Clinics and PBS listings. The 
Government continues to improve aged care, and reform the NDIS to get it back on track.  
The Budget buil ds on the Government ’s commitment to broaden opportunity and advance 
equality. It includes initiatives to support gender equality,  including superannuation on 
Government -funded Paid Parental Leave and support for women affected by violence, and 
makes inves tments in essential services, housing and support for First  Nation s Australians .

Economic and Fiscal  Outlook  
Global growth is expected to remain subdued over the next few years as the effects of high 
inflation, restrictive macroeconomic policies, geopolitical tensions, and challenges in the 
Chinese economy weigh on the outlook. Global growth is forecast to remain  flat at around 
3¼ per cent in 2024 , 2025 , and 2026. This would represent the longest stretch of 
below -average global growth since the early 1990s.  While fighting inflation remains the 
primary task, a s inflation ary pressures  abate  and labour markets soften , the global policy 
focus will begin to  shift to managing risks to growth .  
Australia is not immune from global developments and the combination of moderating but 
high  inflation and high er interest rates have resulted in lower gro wth over the past year . 
Real GDP is forecast to grow by 1¾  per cent in 2023 –24. The Australian economy is well 
placed to navigate these economic challenges, with moderating inflation, a resilient labour 
market, a  return to annual real wage growth and a sol id pipeline of business investment.  
Although inflation remains elevated, it has moderated substantially and is now less than 
half of its peak in 2022 . The moderation  has occurred  more quickly than anticipated at 
MYEFO. While there remains considerable uncertainty around the outlook for the domestic 
and global economy, energy bill relief and Commonwealth Rent Assistance  in this Budget  
are expected to directly  reduce inflation by ½ of a percentage point in 2024 –25 and not 
expected to add to broader inflationary pressures. This could see headline inflation return 
to the target band by the end of 2024, slightly earlier than expected at MYEFO.  
The labour market has been resilient . The unemployment rate is historically low , the 
participation rate is near its record high and employment is growing faster than  any major 
advanced economy over the past year . As labour market conditions continue to ease over 
2024 –25, the unemployment  rate is expected to rise slightly but remain below 
pre-pandemic levels.  
Nominal wage growth has picked up and is growing at its fastest rate in nearly 15  year s. 
The moderation in inflation and pick up in wage growth have contributed to an 
improvement in real wages. Real wages have risen for three consecutive quarters and 
returned to annual growth at the end of 2023, which is earlier than previously forecast. 
Real  wages are  expected to rise further and grow by ½  per cent through -the-year to the 
June  quarter 202 4.  
There is a solid  pipeline of business investment, with annual investment growth expected 
to continue through to 2025 –26. If realised, t his would be the longest sustained increase in 
investment since the mining  boom.   
  |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 6  |  Statement 1: Budget Overview  
Growth is expected to remain subdued  over the forecast period . Real GDP is forecast to 
grow by 2  per cent in 2024 –25, 2¼  per cent in 2025 –26 and 2½  per cent in 2026 –27. Higher 
wages growth, the  forecast moderation in inflation, continuing employment growth and 
the Government ’s cost -of-living tax cuts should support real household disposable incomes 
and a recovery in household consumption.

Following a $22.1  billion  surplus in 2022 –23, another $9. 3 billion  surplus is now forecas t for 
2023 –24 – the first back -to-back surpluses in almost two decades and a $65.9  billion  
improvement from PEFO.  
The Government is supporting monetary policy to keep the pressure off inflation  by 
targeting a surplus and banking 96  per cent of tax receipt upgrades  in 2023 –24. Since 
coming to government, 82  per cent of tax upgrades have been returned to the budget.  
A deficit of $28.3  billion  (1.0 per cent of GDP) is forecast in 2024 –25. The larger deficit is 
driven by the Government’s cost -of-living relief and addressing unavoidable spending 
including terminating health funding and frontline services. Over the six  year s to 2027 –28, 
the underlying cash balance is stronger in every year compared to PEFO and has improved 
by a cumulative $2 14.7 billion .   
The upgrades to receipts in this Budget are much smaller than recent budget updates, at 
around a fifth of the average of the previous three Budgets. This Budget sees tax receipts, 
excluding GST and policy decisions, increasing  since MYEFO  by $8 .2 billion in 2024 –25 and 
$27.0 billion over the forward estimates.  
Real payments growth has been limited to an average 1.4 per cent per year over the period 
since coming to government to 2027 –28, compared to around 3.2 per cent over the past 
30 years . The Government has identified $32.2 billion in budget improvements in this 
Budget, bringing the total to $104.8 billion since coming to government.

Statement 1: Budget Overview   |  Page 7 
Gross debt as a share of the economy is projected to be lower than at MYEFO and PEFO in 
every year o f the forward estimates and medium term, helping to rebuild fiscal buffers to 
prepare for future challenges. Gross debt is projected to be $183.0 billion lower in 2024 –25 
than at PEFO . The improvements to the Budget position since PEFO will save around 
$80 billion in interest costs over the decade .

Responsible economic  management  
The Government’s Economic and Fiscal Strategy is making the economy and the budget 
stronger, more resilient and more sustainable over the medium term. The back -to-back 
surpluses reflect the Government’s discipline to return 96 per cent of tax upgrades to 
Budget in 2023 –24 and 82 per cent of tax upgrades since PEFO. Since coming to 
government real payments growth has been limited to an average 1.4 per cent per year and 
$104.8 billion in budget improvements have been identified  up to 2027 –28. 
The Government is directly reducing inflation through responsible cost -of-living measures. 
In 2024 –25, these measures are estimated to directly reduce inflation by ½ of a percentage 
point and are not expected to add to broader inflationary pressures.   
In this Budget , the Government has identified  $27.9 billion  in savings and spending 
reprioritisations  to support  the Government ’s commitment to improve the quality of 
spending  and ensure spending is targeted at national priorities . This  brings the total 
savings and spending reprioritisations since  PEFO  to $77.4 billion .  
The Budget  also incorporates  the impact of National Disability Insurance Scheme ( NDIS ) 
reforms  being undertaken  by the Government as part of the Getting the NDIS back on track  
measure.  These reforms are expected to offset increases in NDIS payments of $14.4  billion  
over four  year s from 2024 –25, based on the NDIS Actuary ’s revised projections without 
further action.  
This Budget also includes measures  to strengthen the fairness and sustainability of the tax 
system , which will improve the budget by $3.1  billion  over five  year s. This includes  
  |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 8  |  Statement 1: Budget Overview  
funding for the Australian Taxation Office to address fraud, extending tax compliance 
activities focused on domestic and multinational tax avoidance, the shadow economy and 
the personal income tax system , and strengthening  the foreign resident capital gains tax 
regime  to ensure foreign residents pay their fair share of tax in Australia .  
The Government has taken  $15.4 billion  in unavoidable spending  decisions , including  to 
extend terminating programs and continue to address legacy issues left by the former 
Government. Investment in these critical areas ensures that we keep existing programs in 
place to prevent any cuts to the services that Australians rely on. This inclu des funding to :  
• address  pressures at Services Australia, help stabilise claim processing performance and 
continue emergency response capability, continue to operate, maintain and enhance 
myGov, and improve safety for staff and customers   
• address unavoidab le cost pressures for existing projects in the Infrastructure Investment 
Program  
• extend terminating health programs and to continue the COVID -19 response  
• support digital capability and sustainment of aged care systems  
• address underfunding at Home Affairs a nd the Australian Border Force, helping to 
sustain operations and maintain capability to secure our borders.   
Budget priorities  
Easing cost -of-living pressures  
Australia n households  and businesses  are still under pressure from high , but moderating , 
inflation and higher interest rates . In addition to the Government’s cost-of-living tax cuts, 
this Budget delivers a further $7.8  billion in cost -of-living relief.  The Government’s i ncome 
tax changes, energy bill relief , and rent assistance  that will ta ke pressure off households 
and are not expected to add to broader inflationary pressures . The Government is also 
delivering initiatives to build a more competitive and dynamic economy to put downward 
pressure on  prices into the future . 
Tax cuts for every  Australian  taxpayer  
The Government  has legislated tax cuts for all  13.6 million  Australian taxpayers  from 
1 July 2024  to provide cost -of-living relief, return bracket creep and boost labour supply . 
The Government ’s tax changes have been designed to ensure they will not add to the 
inflation outlook .   
Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 1: Budget Overview   |  Page 9 
From 1  July 2024:  
• the 19  per cent tax rate will be reduced to 16  per cent 
• the 32.5  per cent tax rate will be reduced to 30  per cent 
• the income  threshold above which the 37  per cent tax rate applies will be increased from 
$120,000 to $135,000  
• the income  threshold above which the 45  per cent tax rate applies will be increased from 
$180,000 to $190,000 . 
The Government ’s tax cuts return bracket cree p and lower average tax rates for all 
taxpayers , with an average tax cut of $1,888 . Someone earning an average income will pay 
$21,915 less in tax by 2034 –35 as a result of the tax cuts . The reductions in average tax rates 
provide all taxpayers, particularly low - to middle -income taxpayers, with greater 
protection against bracket creep.  
Compared to previously legislated settings, 11.5 million  taxpayers (or 84 per cent of 
taxpayers ) will receive  a bigger tax cut . This includes 2.9 million  lower-income taxpayers 
with taxable income of $45,000 or less, who would not have received any support  
previously . 
The tax cuts are expected to increase labour supply by around 930,000 hours per week, 
equivalent to around  25,000 full time jobs. This increase is primarily driven by  increases in 
hours worked and participation of women  and individuals in the low - to middle -income 
range , particularly  those earning  between $25,000 and $75,000 . All 6.5  million  women 
taxpayers wi ll receive a tax cut in 2024 –25, and 90  per cent of women taxpayers  will get a 
bigger tax cut, increasing the financial return from work and supporting participation.  
The Government  has increased  the Medicare levy low -income thresholds for singles, 
families and seniors from 1  July 2023  to provide additional cost -of-living relief . This will 
mean more than one  million  Australians on lower incomes  continue  to be exempt from 
paying the Medicare  levy or pa y a reduced levy  rate. 
New power bill relief  
The Government  is directly easing cost -of-living pressures  for households and eligible 
small businesses through additional  energy bill relief , which will be extended to  all 
households,  at a cost of  $3.5 billion . From 1  July 2024 , the Government  will deliver rebates 
of $300 to every household and $325 to around  one million  small businesses  across the 
country . Extending  energy b ill relief and expanding it to all household s is expected to 
directly reduce headline inflation  by around  ½ a percentage point  in 2024 –25 and is not 
expected to  add to broader inflationary pressures .  
  |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 10  |  Statement 1: Budget Overview  
Support  for renters  
The Government  recognises that many renters are still facing pressure from rising rents. 
This Budget provides further relief for renters  by increasing maximum rates of 
Commonwealth Rent Assistance by an additional 10 per cent, at a cost of $ 1.9 billion  over 
five year s from 2023 –24. Th is increase will support nearly  one million  households and help 
further relieve rental stress among  low-income households .  
This builds upon relief provided in  the 2023 –24 Budget, where the Government  delivered 
the largest increase in Commonwealth Rent Assistance in more than 30  year s, increasing 
maximum rates by 15  per cent. This is the fi rst back -to-back  real increase in the maximum 
rates of Commonwealth Rent Assistance in more than three  decades .  
Cheaper medicines  
The Government  is continuing to assist households facing cost -of-living pressures by 
keeping down the costs of medicines.  Instead of rising with inflation, medicines will be 
kept cheaper through a one -year freeze on the maximum Pharmaceut ical Benefits Scheme 
(PBS) patient co -payment for everyone with a Medicare card and a five -year freeze for 
pensioners and other concession cardholders. The Government is working to finalise the 
new Eighth Community Pharmacy Agreement, supported by up to an  additional $3  billion  
in funding.   
Supporting students  
The Government will cut $3  billion  in student debt for more than three  million  Australians. 
This will provide relief for everyone with Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) and 
other student loan debt, while continuing to protect the integrity and value of the student 
loan system which has massively expanded access to tertiary educat ion. In response to the 
Universities Accord, the Government will cap the HELP indexation rate to be the lower of 
either the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the Wage Price Index (WPI). The Government will 
backdate this relief to all HELP, VET Student Loan, Au stralian Apprenticeship Support 
Loan and other student support loan accounts that existed on 1 June 2023. This will benefit 
all Australians with a HELP debt, fix last  year ’s spike and prevent growth in debt from 
outpacing wages in the future.  
These change s complement other investments to set students up for success including 
payments for mandatory placements and to apprentices in priority occupations.  
Support for vulnerable Australians  
The Government  is ex tending eligibility for the existing higher base ra te of JobSeeker 
Payment to single JobSeeker Payment recipients with an assessed partial capacity to work 
between zero and 14 hours per week.  Combined with a higher rate of Energy Supplement 
this will provide an increase of at least $54.90 per fortnight  for these  recipients . This is in 
addition to  the broader  $40 fortnightly  base rate increase  for working age and student 
payments  announced in the 2023 –24 Budget and regular indexation increases .   
Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 1: Budget Overview   |  Page 11 
The Government  is also supporting social security recipients to manage their budgets by 
continuing the freeze on social security deeming rates for financial investments at their 
current levels for a further 12  month s until 30 June 2025. This will benefit around 
876,000 income support recipients , including around 4 50,000 Age Pensioners.  
The Government is providing $138.0 million  over five year s for community service s 
delivered  under  the Financial Wellbeing and Capability Activity program , including 
financial resilience, capability building and cris is support . This program supports over 
580,000  people experiencing  financial distress including  to help meet the cost of unexpected 
bills and expenses .  
A fair go for consumers  
The cost of food and groceries is putting many family budgets under significant pressure. 
The Government  is committed to ensuring that the right regulatory settings are in place to 
support a competitive and sustainable food and grocery industry in Australia.  
The Government  has appointed Dr Craig Emerson to review the Food and Grocery Code of 
Conduct, to promote good faith commercial dealings between supermarkets and suppliers. 
The Government  has also directed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission 
(ACCC)  to undertake a price inquiry into the supermarket sector, to ensure Australians are 
paying a fair price for their groceries.  
Further, the Government  has commissioned re spected consumer advocate CHOICE to 
prepare quarterly reports, looking at the comparative cost of a basket of goods from 
retailers. This initiative will help consumers to make an informed choice and save money . 
The Government has announced the biggest refo rm to Australia ’s merger control system in 
almost 50 year s, and is working with state and territory governments over the coming year 
to revitalise National Competition Policy.  These initiatives  will promote a more competitive 
and productive  economy , support living standards and put downward pressure on prices 
into the future . 
Building more homes for Australians  
This Budget invests in delivering the housing and infrastructure needed to support 
Australia ’s thriving cities and regional communities. The Government  is boosting housing 
supply  including social and affordable housing  and investing in infras tructure  to build 
more homes in well -located  areas . The Government  is also  investing in the road, rail and 
port infrastructure needed to make our  cities and regional communities more liveable and 
connect them with each other and to  the world.  
Help to build, rent and buy  
The Government  will make a further $1  billion  available  to the states and territories to 
boost housing supply in well -located areas. This includes funding to unblock local 
infrastructure bottlenecks that are preventing housing from being built by supporting  
  |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 12  |  Statement 1: Budget Overview  
better shared facilities and essential services such as w ater, power, and roads. This 
responds directly to requests from states and territories for an earlier boost to infrastructure 
funding to help them meet National Cabinet ’s 1.2  million  homes target and achieve their 
share of the $3  billion  New Homes Bonus in centive payment being offered by the 
Commonwealth.   
Under the new  National Agreement on Social Housing and Homelessness  the Government  
is offering the states and territories an additional  $423.1 million  over five  year s for social 
housi ng and homelessness services , bringing the total  to $9.3 billion . For this new 
agreement, the Commonwealth will double its dedicated funding allocation for 
homelessness services  – funding the states and territories must match.   
The Government will implement regul atory requirements to ensure public universities 
provide more purpose -built student accommodation. The Government will consult on the 
details of these requirements and transition arrangements prior to commencement. This 
will help increase the supply of stu dent accommodation for all students and will ease 
pressure on the private rental market.   
To encourage investment in the Build  to Rent sector, the Government will allow foreign 
investors to purchase established Build  to Rent developments and apply lower application 
fees to these  investment s. This builds on the Government ’s 2023 –24 MYEFO commitment to 
apply lower fees to foreign investment applications for new Build  to Rent developments . 
Building the construction workfor ce 
To strengthen the pipeline of skilled workers in the construction and housing sector, the 
Government is investing $88.8  million  to deliver 20,000 additional Fee -Free TAFE and VET 
places in courses relevant to construction, including increased access to pre-apprenticeship 
programs. This is on top of more than  355,000 Fee-Free TAFE places delivered in 2023, and 
the 300,000 places being delivered from 2024 to 2026 in areas of skills need.  
The Government will also provide $1.8  million  to deliver streamlined skills assessments for 
around 1,900 migrants from comparable countri es who wish to work in Australia ’s housing 
construction industry . 
More Social and Affordable Housing  
The first $500  million  minimum annual disbursement from the $10 billion  Housing 
Australia Future Fund (HAFF)  will be made  in 2024 –25. These funds  will supp ort social, 
affordable, and acute housing , including for women and children impacted by family 
violence and older women at risk of homelessness.  The Government  will also provide 
additional concessional financing of up to  $1.9 billion  to community housing providers and 
other charities  to support delivery of new social and affordable dwellings under the HAFF 
and the National Housing Accord.  
The Government will further expand the Affordable Housing Bond Aggregator program 
by increasing Housing Austral ia’s liability cap by $2.5  billion  to $10  billion , and lend an 
additional $3  billion  to Housing Australia to support ongoing delivery of the program.  
Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 1: Budget Overview   |  Page 13 
These changes will enable Housing Australia to provide more low -cost finance to 
community housing provider s. 
The Government will target  $1 billion  for social housing under the National Housing 
Infrastructure Facility towards crisis and transitional accommodation for women and 
children fleeing domestic violence, and youth.  
Better transport for cities, regions and suburbs  
The Government  is focusing it s over $120  billion  ten-year  infrastructure investment 
pipeline on nationally significant projects which improve the prosperity, accessibility and 
liveability of our cities, regions  and communities . This Budget provides  $16.5 billion  over 
10 year s from 2024 –25 for priority road and rail infrastructure projects, including additional 
funding of $3.3  billion  for the North East Link and $437.3  million  for suburban road 
upgrades in south eastern and northern Melbourne . 
To ensure Perth has an effective public transport network  to support its growth , this 
Budget provides an additional $1.4  billion  to existing METRONET projects and 
$300  million  for a new High -Capacity Signalling Program . 
This Budget will provide every state and territory with additional fu nding for new and 
existing infrastructure projects over the forward estimates; with $ 9.5 billion  additional 
being provided over the forward estimates . 
Better transport for Western Sydney  
The Government  is committed to unlocking the economic potential of Western Sydney, 
investing $ 2 billion  of additional infrastructure funding this Budget . This  bring s total 
infrastructure investment in Western Sydney to $17.3  billion . 
Investments in more efficient transp ort networks will transform the way communities live 
and move within Western Sydney and connect people to opportunities  in the region. Key 
projects include:  
• $1.9 billion  for priority road and rail projects; including  Mamre Road, Elizabeth Drive, 
and Richmo nd Road from the M7 Motorway to Townson Road  
• $100.0  million  for zero emission rapid bus infrastructure  to connect the metropolitan 
centres of Penrith, Liverpool and Campbelltown to the Western Sydney International 
(Nancy -Bird Walton) Airport and Aerotropolis  at Bradfield . 
Western Sydney International Airport is due to welcome its first travellers and freight in 
2026. The Government  is providing  a further $302.6  million  over five  year s to enable 
operations at the Airport , including for border agenc ies to progress design, fit out and 
commissioning of facilities , provide federal policing and establish a detector dog unit.

Statement 1: Budget Overview   |  Page 15 
resilient economy powered by clean energy, in a way that creates secure, well -paid jobs in 
our regions and suburbs, and benefits communities across Australia.  
The Future Made in Australia plan is complemented by broader government priorities and 
initiatives in this Budget.  These include but are not limited to investments in education, 
defence capabilities, trade and regional engagement and support for small business, 
farmers and regions.  
Attracting investment in key industries  
The Government  will legislate  a Future Made in Australia Act  and establish a National 
Interest Framework to identify priority industries and guide investments associated with 
these industries, to ensure they are responsible and targeted.  
The Framework will have a focus on industries that contribute  to net zero transformation 
where Australia has a comparative advantage, and in areas where Australia has national 
interest imperatives related to economic security and resilience . It will also allow for the 
setting of new Community Benefit Principles to e nsure government investment has flow on 
benefits for the broader Australian community, and will complement the Buy Australian 
Plan and Secure Jobs Plan.  
New front door for investors  
To facilitate the investment Australia ’s dynamic economy needs, the Govern ment will 
establish a new front door for investors with major, transformational investment proposals 
to make it simpler to invest in Australia and attract more global and domestic capital. The 
single point of contact for investors and companies with major investment proposals will 
streamline engagement with government, helping those investors and companies navigate 
approvals processes and fast -tracking major projects where possible.  
It is proposed the new front door will deliver a joined -up approach to inve stment attraction 
and facilitation, identify priority projects  related to the Government ’s Future Made  in 
Australia agenda, support accelerated and coordinated approvals, and connect investors 
with the Government ’s Specialist Investment Vehicles. Its core functions and institutional 
arrangements will be subject to consultation, led by the Treasury.  
The Net Zero Economy Authority (NZEA) will continue to support regions affected by 
energy system change through public and private investment, facilitating worke r 
transition, and driving skills development.  The front door will work in partnership with 
the NZEA to provide investment facilitation support and lead place -based co -investment.  
The mandate of Export Finance Australia ’s National Interest Account will be e xpanded to 
provide financial support for projects where public investment can strengthen the 
alignment of economic incentives with Australia ’s national interests  and incentivise private 
investment at scale in the development of priority industries . Support from the National 
Interest Account will be guided by the National Interest Framework and Community 
Benefit Principles , outlined in Box 1.1 . Export Finance Austr alia will continue to rigorously 
assess the technical and commercial viability of proposed projects.

Strengthening and streamlining  approvals  
The Government is making it easier to invest in transformational projects by streamlining 
approval processes in ways that strengthen standards. Through smarter use of data, better 
decision -making processes and appropriate resourcing, this Budget provides a faster 
pathway to better decisions on environmental, energy, planning, cultural heritage and 
foreign investment  approvals.  
The Government is providing $96.6  million  over four  year s to support timely 
environmental approval decisions by providing more support for project assessments, 
better planning in priority regions and more funding for threatened species research . 
This  Budget provides an additional $19.9  million  over four  year s to support assessment of 
priority renewable energy projects, to support the identification  of national priority 
projects, working in collaboration with states and territories. Together, the se measures 
support the recently announced second stage of the Government ’s Nature Positive Plan. 
The Government is also providing $17.7  million  over three  year s to help reduce the backlog 
and support the administration of complex cultural heritage applica tions in the system.  
The Government  is working in partnership with states and territories to improve approval 
processes for energy infrastructure. This Budget invests $2 0.7 million  over seven  year s in 
improving community engagement in energy infrastructure, including through 
introducing voluntary national standards for renewable energy developers, improving 
community benefits realisation in regional communities, and permanently establishing the 
Aust ralian Energy Infrastructure Commissioner. Through the National  Energy 
Transformation Partnership and support for the Australian Energy Market Operator grid 
connections pilot , the Government is also improving how planning decisions and electricity 
grid con nections  are delivered.  To date, these actions have  fast-tracked  the delivery of an 
additional 3.2 gigawatts of generation capacity . 
Foreign Investment Framework  
This Budget provides $15.7  million  to deliver a stronger, more streamlined and more 
transparen t approach to foreign investment. These reforms will help attract the foreign 
capital flows Australia needs while protecting the national interest in an increasingly 
complex economic and geostrategic environment.  
The Government will apply greater scrutiny to high -risk investments  and enhance 
monitoring and enforcement activities. At the same time, low -risk investments will be 
processed faster to help bring in the capital Australia needs. This will be supported by 
Treasury adopting a new target of processing 50  per cent of foreign investment applications 
within the 30 -day statutory timeframe from 1  January  2025.   
Sustainable finance strategy  
The Government  is investing $1 7.3 million  to deliver its ambitious sustainable finance 
agenda to mobilis e private sector investment  in the net zero transformation . This Budget 
fully funds completion of Australia ’s preliminary sustainable finance taxonomy, as well as 
development of a labelling regime for investment products marketed as sustainable .  
Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 1: Budget Overview   |  Page 17 
An additional $ 1.3 million  will enable  the develop ment  of guidance on best practices for 
businesses disclosing net zero transition plans.   
The Government  is also issuing around $7  billion  of green bonds in 2023 –24 which 
will support  the development of Australia ’s broader  sustainable finance market s. 
The sustainable finance strategy will support reforms such as the new front door for 
investors  and those that enhance Australia ’s ability to attract investment needed to make 
Australia a  renewable energy superpower.   
Making Australia a renewable energy superpower  
The Government is making substantial investments to establish Australia as a renewable 
energy superpower. Maximising the opportunities of cheaper, cleaner, more reliable energy 
and the transformation to net ze ro are foundational in building a future made in Australia .  
Powering Australia with cheaper, cleaner, more reliable energy  
The Government is unlocking over $ 65 billion  of investment in renewable generation and 
clean dispatchable capacity through the Capac ity Investment Scheme. This will transform 
Australia ’s electricity grid and provide the foundation for an economy powered by 
renewables.  
This Budget commits $27.7  million  to help Australians benefit from cheaper, cleaner energy 
sooner by supporting development of priority reforms to ensure consumer energy 
resources, such as rooftop solar, household batteries and electric vehicles , contribut e to our 
grid. It also introduces  the New Vehicle Efficiency Standard, which will save Australians 
around $95  billion  at the bowser by 2050  while reducing transport emissions . 
Unlocking investment in net zero industries and jobs  
This Budget accelerates the growth of new industries by prov iding a $1. 5 billion  extension 
over seven  year s to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency ’s industry -building 
investments and establishing the $1. 7 billion  Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund. 
This Fund will support innovation, commercialisation, pilo t and demonstration projects 
and early stage development in priority sectors, including renewable hydrogen, green 
metals, low carbon liquid fuels and clean energy technology manufacturing such as 
batteries. The Budget also invests $44 .4 million  in an Energ y Industry Jobs Plan and 
$134.2  million  for skills and employment support in  key regions impacted by the net zero 
transition . 
The Government is establishing a Hydrogen Production Tax Incentive for renewable 
hydrogen produced from 2027 –28 to 2039 –40 to incentivise greater investment in renewable 
hydrogen production, at  an estimated cost of $ 6.7 billion  over the decade . This Government 
is also expanding the Hydrogen Headstart program by $ 1.3 billion , supporting early 
movers to invest in the industry ’s development.   
  |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 18  |  Statement 1: Budget Overview  
These investments are supported by an extension to the First  Nation s Renewable Hydrogen 
Engagement Fund and the 2024 National Hydrogen Strategy, which outlines Australia ’s 
approach to becom ing a global hydrogen leader through  the development of a domestic 
low emissions hydrogen industry, working with international partners. Together, these 
new commitments are expected to unlock $50  billion  in private capital investment into the 
Australian re newable hydrogen industry  by 2030 . 
Green metals and low carbon liquid fuels are also  key to Australia ’s net zero 
transformation . This B udget  initiates  further consultation on policy approaches to 
accelerate investment and incentivise efficient production of green metals and low carbon 
liquid fuels.  
Boosting demand for Australia ’s green exports  
The Government is supporting the growth of green industries and making it easier for 
businesses and trading partners to source low -emissions products by developing product 
standards for green products. The Budget provides $ 32.2 million  to fast -track the initial 
phase of the Guarantee of Origin scheme focused on ren ewable hydrogen in 2024 –25, 
before expanding the scheme to accredit the emissions content of green metals and low 
carbon liquid fuels.  
Realising the opportunities of net zero transformation  
Australia is committed to reaching net zero greenhouse gas emis sions by 2050 and is 
developing six sector plans covering electricity and energy, transport, industry, resources, 
agriculture and land, and the built environment. This Budget continues the Government ’s 
investment in effective emissions abatement, including  through $63 .8 million  to support 
emissions reduction efforts in the agriculture and land  sector .  
The Government is also investing $399 .1 million  to establish the Net Zero Economy 
Authority, which will support the economy -wide net zero transformation that  is underway 
by acting as a catalyst for private and public investment, major project development, 
employment transition,  skills and community development. The Budget strengthens 
community engagement in and benefits from the transition by investing $48 .0 million  in the 
reforms to the Australian Carbon Credit Unit scheme and $20 .7 million  to improve 
community engagement and realise community benefits for regional communities affected 
by the energy transition.   
Adding value to resources and strengthening  econ omic security  
Critical minerals are a key input to many clean energy technologies. Scaling the supply of 
critical minerals will be essential in order to support the global transition to net zero by 
2050. Australia can improve the resilience of supply chain s and add more value to our 
resources by processing and refining critical minerals.

Backing a strong resources sector  
Critical minerals are a key input to many clean energy technologies. Scaling the supply of 
critical minerals will be essential to support the global transition to net zero by 2050. 
By adding more value to our resources by processing and refining critical minerals, 
Australia can improve the resilience of global supply chains.  
This Budget establishes a Critical Minerals Production Tax  Incentive for eligible processing 
and refining costs from 2027 –28 to 2039 –40 to incentivise investment in refining and 
processing of the 31 critical minerals  currently  identified on the Government ’s Critical 
Minerals List,  at an estimated cost of $7.0 bil lion over the decade .  
The Government is also partnering with states and territories to complete pre -feasibility 
studies for critical minerals common -use infrastructure through the Critical Minerals 
National Productivity Initiative, and supporting up to $1 .2 billion in priority critical 
minerals projects through the Critical Minerals Facility and Northern Australia 
Infrastructure Facility. This includes the Alpha HPA alumina project in Queensland and 
Arafura Rare Earth ’s Nolans Rare Earth project in the Nor thern Territory.  
The Government is investing $556.1 million over ten years to progressively map Australia ’s 
potential for critical minerals, alternative energy, groundwater and other resources, 
providing scientific information to guide future investment.  
Manufacturing clean energy technologies  
The Government is providing $1. 5 billion  in support administered by the Australian 
Renewable Energy Agency for the manufacturing of clean energy technologies that 
strengthens supply chain resilience. The $1  billion  Solar Sun shot program will incentivise 
private investment in solar panel manufacturing capability and the Battery Breakthrough 
Initiative , costing $523.2  million  over seven  year s, will promote further opportunities to 
add value to Australia ’s critical miner als and target the high -value opportunities in the 
battery manufacturing value chain.  
Building resilient supply chains  
Resilient supply chains will be critical to delivering the Government ’s renewable energy 
superpower  vision. The Government is working with the states and territories through the 
National Energy Transformation Partnership to secure the inputs required to achieve the 
82 per cent renewable energy target. This is on top of the $2.2  million  over two  year s 
previously committed to improve supply chain transparency and identify future demand 
for critical inputs.  
The Government will also invest an additional $14.3  million  to improve the 
competitiveness of the Australian economy by working with trade partners to s upport 
global rules on unfair trade practices and to negotiate benchmarks for trade in high -quality 
critical minerals.

Page 20  |  Statement 1: Budget Overview  
Box 1.1: The Future Made in Australia  National Interest Framework  
The net zero transition and heightened geostrategic competition are transforming 
the global economy. Australia ’s comparative advantages, capabilities and trade 
partnerships mean that these global shifts present a profound opportunity for 
Australian workers and businesses. In certain circumstances, targeted public 
investment can strengthen the alignment of economic incentives with Australia’s 
national interests and incentivise private investment at scale to develop priority 
industries.  
In considering the prudent basis for public investment, the Government has  had 
regard to: Australia’s grounds for lasting competitiveness, the role the industry will 
play in securing an orderly path to net zero and in building Australia’s economic 
resilience and security, whether the industry will build key capabilities, and whe ther 
the barriers to private investment can be resolved through public investment in a 
way that delivers compelling public value.  
These five tests have informed the development of a National Interest Framework 
(the Framework), which will impose rigour on Government’s decision making on 
significant public investments, particularly those used to incentivise private 
investment at scale. The Framework has two streams that will be used to identify 
priority industries and principles for government support.  
• Net zero transformation stream: Industries may warrant public investment 
under this stream if Australia is assessed to have grounds for sustained 
comparative advantage in a net zero global economy, and public investment is 
needed for the sector to make a signi ficant contribution to emissions reduction at 
an efficient cost.  
• Economic resilience and security stream:  Industries may warrant public 
investment under this stream if some level of domestic capability is necessary or 
efficient to deliver adequate economi c resilience and security, and the private 
sector would not invest in this capability in the absence of public investment.  
The Government will apply community benefit principles in relation to investments 
in priority industries. These principles will have  a focus on investment in local 
communities, supply chains and skills, and the promotion of diverse workforces and 
secure jobs.

Reforming tertiary education  and investing in priority skills  
A highly skilled workforce will be a core enabler of the Government ’s ambitious agenda to 
modernise the Australian economy , drive produc tivity growth  and build a future made in 
Australia . This Budget invests to build and enhance Australia ’s human capital base through 
key reforms to the tertiary education sector.  
As part of the response to the Universities Accord, the Government  will set a tertiary 
attainment target of 80  per cent of the working age population to have a VET or higher 
education qualification by 2050. To achieve this target, the Government is committing 
$1.1 billion  over five  year s, and an additional $2.7  billion  from 2028 –29 to 2034 –35, to 
expand access to higher education and support future productivity . 
Broadening access to university  
Increasing tertiary attainment and meeting the 80  per cent target will require greater 
numbers of underrepresented students to a ttend university. To help more of these students 
succeed, the Government is committing to needs -based funding. Universities will receive 
additional funding to provide dedicated support to students from low -socioeconomic 
backgrounds, First  Nations students,  students with disability and students studying at 
regional campuses.  
The Government will also redesign the university funding model to drive attainment levels 
that meet our long -term skills needs. To provide more pathways to university for students 
who do  not qualify for direct entry, the Government is also investing $350.3  million to 
expand access to free university enabling courses from 1  January  2025.

Payments to students studying in critical sectors while they undertake mandatory 
placements. Support will be available to nursing including midwifery, teaching and social 
work students in higher education and nursing students in VET. Eligi ble students will 
receive payments of $319.50 per week for the duration of their placement.  This is expected 
to support more than 73,000 students per year, will help to alleviate the financial impact of 
being on placement and will support retention in cour ses related to sectors with skills 
shortages.  
Investing in priority skills  
The Government is supporting gender equality and women ’s participation by driving 
structural and cultural change in work and training environments in traditionally 
male -dominated industries. The Government is investing $55.6  million to launch the 
Building Women ’s Careers program which will deliver around ten large -scale proje cts, and 
several smaller local projects, to support women to access flexible training in clean energy, 
construction, tech and advanced manufacturing.  
To support apprentice retention and completion rates, the Government has committed to 
increase Phase Two Incentive System payments for apprentices in priority occupations 
from $3,000 to $5,000 and hiring incentives for priority occupation employers from 
$4,000 to $5,000 for 12 months from 1 July 2024. This will provide certainty to apprentices 
while the Gover nment awaits the findings of the Strategic Review of the Australian 
Apprenticeship Incentive System . 
To strengthen the pipeline of skills in the construction sector, the Government is investing 
$88.8  million to deliver 20,000 additional Fee -Free TAFE place s in courses relevant to 
construction, including increased access to pre -apprenticeship programs. This is on top of 
more than 355,000 Fee -Free TAFE places delivered in 2023, and the 300,000 places being 
delivered from 2024 to 2026 in areas of skills need.   
The Government is investing $91.0  million to develop the clean energy workforce, 
including by turbocharging the VET teacher, trainer and assessor workforce, and funding 
clean energy training facility upgrades and capacity expansion. Expanded eligibility f or the 
New Energy Apprenticeships Program will also allow more apprentices to access $10,000 
payments and will increase completions in priority sectors. Eligible Group Training 
Organisations will be reimbursed for reducing fees to small -to-medium enterpris es seeking 
clean energy, manufacturing, and construction apprentices.   
The Government is reforming Australia ’s migration system to drive greater economic 
prosperity and restore its integrity, implementing actions outlined in the Migration 
Strategy. This Bu dget supports skills in demand, with around 70 per cent of the permanent 
Migration Program allocated to skilled visa categories. The Government will also introduce 
a new National Innovation visa to attract exceptionally talented migrants and replace the 
Global Talent visa and the Business Innovation and Investment visa. These actions 
complement reforms being developed for the points test used for certain skilled visas.

Industrial Priorities, including continuous naval shipbuilding and sustainment, domestic 
manufacture of guided weapons, explosive ordnance and munitions, and development and 
integration of autonomous systems.   
Securing  Australia ’s place in the world  
Successfully developing a new industrial base in Australia depends on our ability to 
compete in global markets and sell Australian products to the world. Strengthening  trade 
partnerships can bolster  supply chains and improve the competitiveness of Australi a’s 
economy as it transitions to net zero .  
Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 1: Budget Overview   |  Page 25 
This Budget includes $14.3  million  to improve the competitiveness of the Australian 
economy by working with trade partners to support global rules on unfair trade practices 
and to negotiate benchmarks for trade in  high quality critical minerals. This Future Made  in 
Australia agenda will drive a set of initiatives designed to deliver concrete benefits to 
industries central to a future made in Australia, and begin to shape an international trading 
environment that su pports Australia ’s comparative advantages.  
From 1  July 2024 , the Government will abolish 457 nuisance tariffs at a cost of $ 41 million  
over  five year s from 2023 –24. The largest unilateral tariff reform in two decades will boost 
productivity, reduce red tape and simplify the tariff system. It will streamline 
approximately $ 8.5 billion  in trade, sav ing Australian businesses approximately $30 million  
per year  in compliance costs .  
The Government is also making  trade faster, easier and cheaper. This  is a $29.9  million  
investment includes a Simplified Trade System unit to drive integrated cross -border trade 
reforms, and a new Digital Trade Accelerator Program to give businesse s new, secure 
digital access to important trade data, with enhanced risk assessments to better facilitate

Statement 2: Economic Outlook   |  Page 39 Statement 2:  
Economic Outlook  
Global  growth  is forecast to remain subdued  over  the next few years  and is expected to  
record  the longest stretch of below -average  growth since the early 1990s.  Tackling  inflation 
remains the primary focus but, as inflation ary pressures abate  and labour markets soften , 
the global  polic y focus will increasingly shift to managing risks to growth . 
Several global factors pose  risks to the outlook. Monetary policy settings could remain tight 
for an extended period  due to persistent inflation . Heightened geopolitical tensions in the 
Middle East have added to the risks associated with Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine. A further  
escalation  in geopolitical tensions could add to energy costs, disrupt international trade, 
and slow global growth. The outlook for  the Chinese economy , including the property 
sector,  also remains uncertain . 
Australia is not immune from global developments  and the combination of elevated  
inflation and high interest rates  here  has resulted in lower  growth over the past year. These 
factors have put people  under pressure, with household consumption  flat over  the past 
year. High interest rates and ongoing supply constraints have also weighed on dwelling 
investment.  These factors are expected to  see real GDP growth of 1¾ per cent in 2023–24. 
The Australian economy is well placed to navigate these economic challenges . Inflation is  
moderating, the labour market  has been resilient , annual real wage s are grow ing for the 
first time in y ears and there is a solid pipeline of business investment.  This means that 
Australia can face global and domestic challenges from a position of economic strength.  
Although inflation remains elevated, it has moderated substantially and is now less than 
half of its peak in 2022. The moderation in inflation has occurred more quickly than forecast 
at MYEFO, with inflation now expected to be lower in 2023 –24.  
While there remains considerable uncertainty around the outlook for the domestic and 
global economy, th e Government ’s responsible cost -of-living measures will provide relief 
for households . Energy bill relief and rent assistance are estimated  to directly reduce 
headline inflation by ½ of a percentage point in 2024 –25 and are not expected to add to 
broader inflationary pressures . This could see headline inflation return to the Reserve Bank  
of Australia ’s target band by the end of 2024, slightly earlier than expected at MYEFO. This 
will ease pressure on households and h elp to keep inflation expectations well  anchored.  
The labour market  has been  resilient with the unemployment  rate remaining near its 
50-year  low at  3.8 per cent, the participation rate near its record high at 66. 6 per cent, and 
employment growing faster than any major advanced economy.  However, t here are clear 
signs that labour market conditions are softening. So far, a decline in average hours worked 
has delayed the expected moderation in employment growth and an associated  modest 
increase in the unemployment rate. As labour market conditions continue to ease over 
2024–25, the unemployment rate is expected to rise but remain below pre -pandemic levels.   
Page 40  |  Statement 2: Economic Outlook  Nominal wages over 2023 –24 have grown at their fastest rate in nearly 15  years , reflecting  
recent  labour market  strength , as well as Fair Work Commission determinations on the 
minimum  wage and the Aged Care Work Value Case . As the labour market softens, 
nominal wage growth is expected to soften to 3¼ per cent in both 2024–25 and 2025 –26. 
The moderation in inflation and pick -up in wage growth have contributed to an 
improvement in real wages. Real wages have risen  for three consecutive quarters and 
returned to annual growth at the end of 2023, earlier than  previously forecast. Real wage s 
are expected to continue to pick  up and grow by ½ per cent through the year to the 
June  quarter 2024.  
Business investment has  with stood the global and domestic pressures, growing by a strong 
8.3 per cent last year.  The upswing in business investment is expected to continue through 
to 2025–26 and, if realised, will be the longest sustained increase in business investment 
since the mining boom.  
Growth is expected to remain subdued over the forecast period.  Real GDP is forecast  to 
grow by 2 per cent in 2024 –25, and 2¼ per cent in 2025 –26. Higher wages growth, the 
forecast  moderation in inflation, continuing employment growth and the Government ’s 
cost‑of‑living tax cuts should  support  real household disposable incomes and  a recovery in 
household consumption  (see Box  2.1). 
The improvement in household consumption is expected to be complemented by an 
elevated level of business investment  and a gradual pick -up in dwelling investment as cost 
pressures  ease  and asset returns improve . Services exports are also expected to contribute 
to growth as  the recovery in  the number of international students and tourists  continues. 
Productivity, which has grown for two consecutive quarters, is expected to continue  to pick 
up as economic conditions improve.  
Domestically, there is a risk that  household consumption may not respond  as quickly  as 
expected to the anticipated  recover y in real disposable incomes , particularly if households , 
facing budget constraints , instead seek to replenish savings or if employment growth is 
slower than forecast . Inflation could also be more persistent  than forecast and d elay the 
return of inflation to the target  band .

Statement 2: Economic Outlook   |  Page 43 Statement 2: Economic Outlook  
Outlook for the international economy  
Outlook for global growth  
Global growth is expected to remain subdued over the next few years  as the effects of high 
inflation , restrictive macroeconomic  polic ies, geopolitical tensions , and challenges in the 
Chinese economy  weigh on the outlook . If inflation ary pressures  continue to ease  as 
expected, the global policy focus will increasingly shift to managing risks to growth.  
Most advanced economies recorded subdued outcomes  during 2023, with around a third of 
OECD  nations  record ing a technical recession. The United States has been the notable 
exception where earlier disinflation  and a strong recovery in productivity have contributed 
to the economy  consistently  exceeding  expectations .  
Global growth is forecast to  remain flat at arou nd 3¼ per cent in 2024 , 2025  and 2026  
(Chart s 2.1 and 2.2; Table  2.1). If realised, this would represent  the longest stretch of  
below -average growth since the early 1990s . Major t rading partner growth is also expected 
to remain subdued at 3¼ per cent in 2024 , 2025  and 2026  as a forecast softening  in China  
offsets a modest pickup elsewhere .

Market pricing implies that c entral banks in most advanced economies are likely to have 
reached the peak in their monetary policy tightening phases  (Chart  2.3). An exception is the 
Bank of Japan , which only began to withdraw longstanding  monetary policy stimulus in 
March 2024 after emerging from decades of deflation and weak growth.  
Market pricing also implies that most  advanced economy central banks will begin easing 
monetary policy later this year.  However , this policy easing is now expected to occur later 
than  had been priced in earlier in the year given inflation has been more persistent than 
forecast .

Outlook for global inflation  
Inflation in advanced economies has declined  significantly  since peaking in mid -to-late 
2022  (Chart  2.4). Nonetheless, inflation generally remains elevated  and is not expected to 
return to central bank targets until 2025  (Chart  2.5).  
The r apid increase  in goods and energy prices associated with earlier supply and demand 
shocks , including the pandemic and Russ ia’s inv asion of Ukraine , have largely dissipated . 
With the disinflation in goods and energy prices having mostly run its course , services 
inflation remains the main driver of above -target inflation .  
Strong  rental inflation , solid nominal wage s growth , and the continued pass -through of 
earlier increases in other input costs , have  contributed to persistent services inflation  in 
many advanced economies .  
To date , the decline in inflation in advanced economies  has not been  associated with a 
significant  increase in unemployment , which is  consistent with a soft landing . Nonetheless , 
wage growth has  begun  to moderate  and medium -term inflation expectations have 
generally remained well anchored around central bank inflation targets, mitigating  the risk 
of a wage -price spiral .  
In contrast to most  advanced  economies, China has  experienced  a period of low inflation 
amid weakness in domestic demand and deleveraging by developers in the property 
sector.

Key risks to the international outlook  
The global outlook remains  complex and uncertain . Heightened geopolitical tensions in the 
Middle East have added to the risks associated with Russia ’s invasion of  Ukraine . A further 
escalation in geopolitical tensions  remain s a key  risk to inflation  and global growth , with  
the potential to disrupt energy and commodity markets  and increase shipping costs by 
compromising traditiona l trade  routes .  
Elevated geopolitical risk s have been reflected in asset  markets  during 2024 . The price of 
gold  increased  sharply to all -time highs  supported by safe -haven demand  (Chart  2.6), and 
oil prices firm ed to six-month highs  in mid -April  in response to the escalation of tensions 
between Iran and Israel  (Chart  2.7).

The evolution of global inflation and associated  implications for the timing of  monetary 
policy easing remain a key risk to the outlook. If inflation proves to be more persistent than 
expected, monetary  policy settings may need to remain restr ictive  for longer . There may 
also be implications for financial stability . For example, i n the United States, a prolonge d 
period of high interest rates could  generate additional stress in the commercial real estate  
sector.  
Developments in China also present significant risks  to global demand , particularly for key 
trading partners including Australia . Sharper or more p ersistent weakness  in Chinese 
domestic demand associated with deleveraging in the residential property sector represents 
a downside risk  to growth , particularly if it leads to more acute pressures in the Chinese 
financial system that adversely  affects  the balance sheet s of households and local 
governments . In the near term, stronger -than -expec ted fiscal policy expansion  would 
present a n upside risk  to Chinese growth .  
Some governments,  particularly  in Europe , will be under pressure  to repair public finances 
given the considerable expansion in debt and deficits to support growth during the 
pandemic and , more recently,  to ease cost -of-livin g pressures. Fiscal consolidation may 
prove difficult due to a deterioration in the outlook for fiscal revenues in some economies, 
presenting longer -term challenges. At the same time, if consolidation is too rapid, it could 
disrupt growth.

Page 48  |  Statement 2: Economic Outlook  
Outlook for ma jor trading  partners  
China’s economy is forecast to grow by 4¾ per cent in 202 4, broadly in line with  the 
Chinese government ’s target  of around 5  per cent, and then slow to  4¼ per cent in 202 5 and 
2026. If realised , this will be the slowest period of economic growth since the Chinese  
economy began opening up in  the late 1970s.   
In 2023, the Chinese economy  grew by 5. 2 per cent as investment in infrastructure  and 
manufacturing offset  weakness in residential property investment and consum er spending . 
Further  adjustment in the residential property sector  is expected  to remain  a drag on 
growth . Falling prices and  financial stress in the residential construction sector  will 
continue to weigh  on consumer confidence  and spending . Local government s also have  
limited capacity to support growth as finances  are strained  due to a reliance on property 
sales for revenue .  
The Chinese economy faces increasing structural challenges from slowing urbanisation, an 
ageing population and lower  productivity growth . Authorities are attempting to address 
these structural challenges by supporting  new industries, such as electric vehicles and 
green energy, while pivoting away from traditional growth drivers, such as property.  
The United States  is forecast to grow by 2½  per cent in 2024, 1½  per cent in 2025 and 
2 per cent in 2026. The US recorded  stronger -than -expected growth through 2023 , while 
inflation moderated largely as expected. This  reflected  buoyant demand and an expansion 
in supply  capacity , given  strong employment growth and  a rebound in productivity.   
Positive momentum in household consumption and business investment  has carried over 
into 2024. Strong employment growth and  a lift  in real wages have supported consumption 
growth . Business investment has been boosted by government stimulus and tax incentiv es, 
including for investment in renewable energy . The impact of monetary policy tightening on 
growth has been more muted than expected . Stronger activity in 2023 and 2024 has pushed 
out the expected timing and quantum of monetary policy easing .  
Growth is expected to slow  somewhat  in the second half of 2024 and into 2025 as an easing 
in the labour market , diminished  household savings buffers  that accumulated during the 
pandemic  and less accommodative fiscal  policy weigh on activity . 
Monetary policy easing in the United States is assumed to commence towards the end of 
2024 as inflation returns towards the Federal Reserve ’s target. Market pricing implies a 
slower pace of easing than was expected earlier in the year as progress towards the Federal 
Reserve’s inflation target has slowed. Monetary policy easing from later this year would 
support a modest cyclical upswing towards the end of 2025.  
Euro area  GDP is forecast to grow by ¾ per cent in 202 4, 1½ per cent in 202 5 and 
1½ per cent in 202 6. The euro area  economy  experienced a mild  recession  in the second half 
of 2023  and its  largest economy, Germany, contracted in 2023 . Euro  area manufactur ers 
suffered a loss of market share due to sharp increases in energy costs  and increased 
competition from China , particularly in emerging industries  such as electric vehicle  
manufacturing .  
Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 2: Economic Outlook   |  Page 49 
Euro area growth is expected to pick  up during 2024 . Declining inflation is expected to  
support  a recovery in real disposable income  growth and household consumption  across 
the region . The European Central Bank is also expected to begin easing monetary policy 
from mid -2024 , which will provide further support for growth into 2025 . Fiscal policy 
across the euro are a will, however, drag on  growth  in 2024 a nd 2025  as fiscal support to 
cushion the impact of high energy costs is withdraw n and some member states  reduce  their 
deficits to conf orm with  EU fiscal rules . 
The United Kingdom  is forecast to grow by ½ per cent in 202 4, 1¼ per cent in 2025 and 
1½ per cent in 202 6. The United Kingdom  entered a technical recession during the second 
half of 2023 due to  high energy costs , cost-of-living pressures , restrictive monetary policy , 
and a decline in export s exacerbated by continued EU trade frictions  following Brexit . Real 
income growth driven by moderating inflation will support a recovery in consumption 
growth across the forecast period , with monetary policy easing also expected to be a 
tailwind . 
Japan  is forecast to grow by ¾ per cent in 202 4 and 1  per cent in 202 5 and 202 6. Japan 
recorded solid growth in the first half of 2023 supported by  strong inbound tourism and the 
resolution of supply chain disruptions in the auto industry . However, growth  slowed  in the 
second half of the year  as falling real wages  weighed on  consumption  growth . 
Recent wage negotiati ons impl y a marked lift in the pace of nominal wages growth  in 2024 , 
which is expected to support real wages growth as inflation  moderates . This, al ongside  
household s’ access to  savings accumulated during the pandemic, is expected to support 
a mild rebound in consumption growth . High corporate profits and the  strengthening  of 
supply chains are also expected to support business investment in the near term.   
The Bank of Japan began withdrawing extraord inary monetary policy stimulus in 
March  2024  and is expected to gradually normalise  its policy stance . Nonetheless, monetary 
policy  is likely  to remain accommodative for some  time.   
India  is forecast to grow by 6½  per cent in 2024, 2025 and 2026. Growth in India was 
stronger than expected in 2023 and was driven by public investment in transport and 
energy infrastructure. India is expected to remain one of the world ’s fastest growing major 
economies over the next two years. Public investment is expe cted to remain a key source of 
growth though it will be dampened by expected fiscal consolidation. Restrictive monetary 
policy is expected to weigh somewhat on consumption and private investment growth in 
the near  term.  
Other East Asia  is forecast to grow  by 4 per cent in 202 4 and 202 5 and 4¼ per cent in 2026. 
Growth in the region is expected to be supported by rising domestic demand , an upturn in 
exports  of goods and services , and continued recovery in the tourism sector . Foreign direct 
investment inflows  are also expected to remain strong as multinationals continue to 
diversify their manufacturing supply chains .

Page 50  |  Statement 2: Economic Outlook  
Outlook  for the domestic economy  
The Australian economy has slowed  in response  to elevated inflation  and higher interest 
rates  here  and the impact  of global economic volatility . These factors have put people  
under pressure, weighing on consumption growth and dwelling investment  (Chart  2.8). 
However, t he economy is well  placed to face these global and domestic economic 
challenges, with  moderating inflation, a resilient labour market , a return to annual real 
wage growth  and strong business investment . 
Household consumption was flat over the past year, as people have responded to 
cost-of-living pressure by pulling back on discretionary sp ending to make room for 
essentials. Higher interest rates and elevated construction costs are weighing on the 
demand for new housing , with dwelling investment expected to contract further in  
2023–24.  
Although inflation remains elevated, it has moderated substantially and is now less than 
half of its peak in 2022. The moderation in inflation has occurred more quickly than forecast 
at MYEFO, with inflation now expected to be lower in 2023 –24.  
While there remains considerable uncertainty around the outlook for the domestic and 
global economy, the Government ’s targeted cost -of-living measures are expected to reduce 
inflation . Energy bill relief and Commonwealth Rent Assistance is expected to directly 
reduce inflation  by ½ of a percentage point in 2024 –25 and is not expected to add to 
broader inflationary pressures  (see Box  2.2). This could see headline inflation return to the 
target band by the end of 2024, slightly earlier than expected at MYEFO. This will ease 
pressure on households and help to keep inflation expectations well  anchored.  
The labour market  has been resilient, with faster employment growth than any major 
advanced economy, near historically low unemployment, and the participation rate near its 
record high.  However, c onditions in the labou r market are softening and are expected to 
ease further over 2024 –25. The unemployment rate is expected to remain low by historical 
standards but rise gradually to 4½ per cent by the June quarter 2025.  
Nominal wages are grow ing at 4.2 per cent, their faste st annual rate in nearly 15 years. This 
has been driven by recent strength in the labour market and administered wage decisions. 
As labour market conditions ease, annual wage growth is expected to decline to 
3¼ per cent in 2024 –25 and 2025 –26. Moderating i nflation and a pick -up in wage growth 
resulted in a return to positive annual real wage growth at the end of 2023. Real wages are 
expected to rise by  ½ per cent  through the year to the June quarter 2024.  
Business investment has withstood the global and domestic pressures  and grew strong ly at  
8.3 per cent last year. The upswing in business investment is expected to continue through 
to 2025–26 and, if realised, will be the longest sustained increase in business investment 
since the mining boom.   
Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 2: Economic Outlook   |  Page 51 
Growth is expected to remain  subdued over the forecast period. Real GDP is forecast  to 
grow by 2 per cent in 2024 –25, and 2¼ per cent in 2025 –26 (Chart 2.9) . Higher wages 
growth, the forecast  moderation in inflation , continuing  employment growth  and the 
Government ’s cost‑of‑living tax cuts should support  real household disposable incomes 
and a recovery in household consumption. The cash rate is assumed to gradually ease from 
around the middle of 2025 to reach 3.6  per cent by the middle of 2026.  
Recent strength in bu siness investment, net exports and public investment is expected to 
continue  and provide further support  for the economy. Net exports are expected to 
contribute to growth in 2024 –25 driven by the ongoing recovery of services exports. Public 
final demand is expected to support activity, driven by a record infrastructure investment 
pipeline and the Australian  and state governments ’ strengthening essential government 
services.  
There are substantial risks to the domestic outlook. Inflation could prove more persistent 
than forecast, with possible implications for policy settings and growth. If productivity 
does not pick up  as expected, price pressures may be more persistent , with potential  
implications for unemployment and the real economy.  There is also significant uncertainty 
about how quickly aggregate household consumption will respond to the expected 
recovery in real d isposable incomes.  
Internationally, there remains a risk that current geopolitical tensions could escalat e into 
larger economic shocks that could derail the global recovery , with implications for  
Australian exports and supply chains. If downside risks to Chinese growth crystalise, this 
could  directly impact the domestic economy through weaker commodity prices and lower 
national income . In the medium term , this  could also impact activity through weaker 
mining investment and resources export s.

Household consumption  
Household s have pulled back sharply on consumer  spending in response to sustained 
cost-of-living pressures  and higher interest rates  (Chart  2.10) . However, higher wages 
growth, the forecast moderation in inflation, continuing employment growth and the 
Government ’s cost‑of‑living tax cuts are expected to support real household disposable 
incomes and household c onsumption from the second half of 2024 (see Box  2.1).  
Household consumption was broadly flat  over 2023 . With  subdued growth in real 
household disposable income,  consumption is expected to remain weak  in the first half of 
2024  (Chart  2.11) . A recovery  in real disposable income growth is then expected to support  
household consumption , which is forecast to grow  by 2 per cent in 2024 –25 and 2¾ per cent 
in 2025–26.  
There remains significant uncertainty around the responsive ness  of household 
consum ption to  evolving economic  conditions . While aggregate  real household disposable 
income is expected to pick  up in 2024–25, households  will still face tight budgets  and may  
look  to replenish savings  as their real incomes  increase . A faster -than -anticipated  softening 
in labour market conditions could  also temper the rec overy in consumptio n.

Box 2.1: Recovery  in real household disposable income  
Real disposable income is forecast to  grow by 3 ½ per cent in 2024 –25 (Chart  1). This is 
expected to be driven by a 4 ½ percentage point  contribution from growth in  labour 
incomes and a 1  percentage point contribution from the Government ’s cost -of-living 
tax cuts . Inflation is expected to be  a smaller drag on real incomes  compared to  recent 
years . If realised, this would be the fastest rate in over a decade (excluding the 
pandemic).  
Austral ia’s resilient  labour market and historically low unemployment rate means 
more Australian s have jobs . Employment  in Australia grew  faster than in any major 
advanced economy over the past year , with m ore Australian s now secur ing 
meaningful work. Employment  is expected to continue to grow  next year , even as the 
labour market  softens in respon se to weaker growth . Nominal wages are now growing 
at their fastest rate in nearly 15 year s. This is due to strength in the labour market and 
the Fair Work Commission ’s wage determinations , which the Government support ed. 
Continue d growth in wages will contribute  to the improvement  in household 
disposable incomes ove r the coming year.   
The Government ’s cost-of-living tax cuts will ensure households keep a greater 
proportion of their incomes to help navigate cost -of-living pressures. Compared to 
previously legislated settings,  11.5 million taxpayers will receive a larger tax cut.  
The Government ’s tax cuts deliver a permanent reduction in tax for all taxpayers, with 
an average tax cut of $1,888 in 2024 –25 compared to 2023 –24 settings.   
In addition, the continued moderation of inflation  and the Government ’s responsible  
cost-of-living policies  will strengthen  the purchasing power of households .

Dwelling  investment  
Higher interest rates and elevated construction costs are w eighing on the demand for new 
housing  (Chart  2.12) . These factors are expected to cause dwelling investment to contract  
by 3 per cent in 2023 –24 and remain flat in 2024 –25. Alongside an improvement in 
household finances  and asset returns , growth in new dwelling investment is expected to 
increase to  6½ per cent in 2025–26 (Chart  2.13).  
Government initiatives to increase housing supply will help to support an increase in the 
stock of dwellings . The Government ’s $32 billion housing plan will deliver the biggest 
investment in social housing in over a decade, enable construction of more home s, reduce 
red tape and planning hurdles , train the necessary workforce , and support Australians into 
home ownership and those in the rental market . These initiatives will help support  the 
shared Australian  and state governments ’ ambition to deliver  1.2 million new homes over 
the next five years .

Business investment  
Recent g rowth in b usiness  investment has been  underpinned by strong business balance 
sheets, elevated capacity utilisation, and resilient business sentiment . The upswing is 
expected to continue through to 2025 –26 and , if realised , would  be the longest sustained 
increase in business investment since the mining boom  (Chart  2.14).  
The positive  outlook for business investment is reflected in the strength of recent outcomes 
as well as  forward -looking capital expenditure intentions  (Chart 2.15) . High levels of 
capacity utilisation  and the desire to drive cost efficiencies has, to date , offset  the impact of  
global uncertainty and the drag from the slowdown in household demand . A large pipeline 
of non -dwelling construction projects should underpin near -term growth  with business  
investment  forecast to grow by 5½  per cent in 2023–24. 
Business investment is expected to remain at high levels , with growth expected to be 
1 per cent in 2024–25 and  2 per cent in 2025–26, as the pipeline o f non-dwelling  
construction projects is worked through.  Moderating domestic demand is expected to see 
investment in  machinery and equipment ease, albeit from  elevated levels .  
At the sectoral level, n on-mining investment is expected to be the main driver of growth in 
business investment over the coming years . Non -mining investment is forecast to increase  
by 5½ per cent in 2023 –24, 2½ per cent in 2024 –25 and 2  per cent in 2025 –26. Continued 
expenditure on n on-dwelling  construction projects is driving growth throughout the 
profile , with investment s focussed on renewable energy infrastructure , data centres and 
warehouses .

Page 58  |  Statement 2: Economic Outlook  
The outlook for mining investment primarily reflects expenditure to maintain existing 
resource production capacity along wi th a modest number of new LNG and metal ore 
projects. Mining investment is expected to grow by 4½  per cent in 2023 –24, before falling by 
3½ per cent in 2024 –25 as large projects are worked through. In 20 25–26, growth in mining 
investment is expected to pick  up to  2 per cent.

Public final demand  
Public final demand is forecast to rise by 4½ per cent in 2023 –24, before slowing to 
1½ per cent in 2024 –25 and 2025 –26 (Chart 2. 16). Government expenditure on goods and 
services  is expected to continue to grow , which ref lects , in part,  an increase in public health 
spending  by all levels of government .  
A large pipeline of public infrastructure projects at the state and federal  level  is expected to 
support public investment  (Chart 2. 17). As capacity constraints ease , this will allow  the 
pipeline of projects , including on energy, water and transport infrastructure , to be worked 
through  and support  growth .

Net exports  
Net exports are expected to add ¾  of a percentage point to  GDP  growth in 2023 –24 and 
½ of a percentage point in 2024 –25 (Chart  2.18) . This  is largely the result of the  ongoing 
rebound in servic es exports  following the pandemic . In 2025–26, net exports are expected to 
subtract ¼ of a percentage point from GDP growth . This is largely due to the anticipated  
moderation in  mining exports and increase in  goods imports , which reflects  the forecast 
upswing in household consumption and strong business investment .  
Exports are forecast to  grow by 5  per cent in  both 2023–24 and 2024 –25 (Chart  2.19) . This 
reflects the expected ongoing  recovery in tourism and international education  exports  
follo wing the prolonged period of international border  closures during the pandemic . A 
recovery in mining exports  from  weather and supply disruptions  is also forecast  to support 
export growth. Export growth is then expected to slow to 2½  per cent in 2025 –26, which is 
consistent with moderat ing growth in mining and services exports.  
Imports growth is forecast to moderate to  2½ per cent in 2023 –24, reflecting  weaker 
domestic demand for goods  imports  and an expect ed moderation in  service imports  
growth  with Australians prioritising closer and less expensive holiday destinations amid 
cost-of-living pressures. Growth in imports  is expected to pick  up to 4  per cent in 2024 –25 
and then 4½  per cent in 2025 –26, as domestic demand improves .

Inflation  
Although inflation remains elevated, it has moderated substantially and is now less than 
half of its peak in 202 2. The moderation in inflation has occurred more quickly than forecast 
at MYEFO. Inflation is expected to be 3 ½ per cent through the year to the June  quarter 2024, 
¼ of a percentage point lower  than previously forecast.  This moderation in inflation has 
been  assisted by a continued easing  of goods inflation – and the Government ’s 
cost-of-living policies . 
While there remains considerable uncertainty around the outlook for the domestic and 
global economy, the Government ’s responsible  cost-of-living measures could see headline 
inflation return to the target band by the end of 2024, slightly earlier than expected at 
MYEFO (Chart 2. 20). This will ease pressure on households and help to keep inflation 
expectations well -anchored.  
Annual headline inflation moderated  to 3.6 per cent in the March quarter 2024 , well 
below  its peak  of 7.8  per cent (Chart 2. 21). The Energy Price Relief Plan  and increases to 
Commonwealth Rent Assistance are estimated to  reduc e measured  inflation  in 2023–24 
by ¾ of a percent age point . The extension of the Energy Bill Relief Fund ( EBRF ) and the 
further increase in Commonwealth Rent Assistance  payments  announced in this Budget 
are expected to directly reduce headline inflation by  ½ a percentage point  in 2024–25 
(see Box 2.2).   
Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 2: Economic Outlook   |  Page 61 
The peak in s ervices inflation  lagged that of goods inflation . Services inflation remains 
elevated,  driven by the increased cost of business  inputs . However, services inflation  is 
expected to gradually  normalise over the next two years . 
Rental  market  conditions remain very tight, with national vacancy rates persisting at near 
record lows . National  advertised rents grew  at over 8  per cent in the year  to April  2024 . 
Growth in rental costs is expected to remain elevated as increases in advertised rents flow 
through with the renewal of  existing leases.  Over the forecast horizon , rental pressures are 
expected to  gradually ease. The demand for rental accommodation has increase d sharply , 
owing to the reopening of international borders  and strong nominal income growth . On the 
supply side, high interest rates and elevated costs of construction  are weighing on activity , 
limit ing the pace at which housing supply  catch es up to demand .  
While inflation expectations over the medium -term have remained well -anchored , the re are 
several  risks to the inflation  outlook . While productivity  has grown for two consecutive 
quarters, the extent to which productivity growth will r ecover  remains uncertain . A slower 
recover y in productivity growth could have implications for both inflation and growth.  
Any further escalation of current geopolitical tensions  also present risks to the outlook .

Box 2. 2: The impact of  cost-of-living relief  on inflation  
The Government ’s cost -of-living policies are providing responsi ble relief to  
households and small businesses  with cost -of-living pressures .  
The Government ’s existing  Energy Price R elief Plan  (EPRP) , Cheaper Child Care and 
boost to Commonwealth Rent Assistance are directly easing cost -of-living pressures . 
These  targeted  polices are expected to  take ¾ of a percentage point off inflation  in 
2023 -24. New p olicies as part of the 2024 –25 Budget will provide further 
cost-of-living relief for households . The Government ’s energy bill relief will support 
all households wi th their energy bills.  
The Government ’s EPRP  has shield ed households from the worst effects  of the 
extraordinary energy price rises in 2022–23 and 2023 –24. The E PRP included 
temporary caps on  wholesale coal and gas prices and up to  $3 billion of targeted 
energy bill relief for households and small businesses , jointly funded by the 
Australian  and state and territory governments. From the June quarter 2023  to the 
March quarter 2024, household  energy bill relief directly reduce d growth in CPI 
electricity price s by 12.9 percentage points (Chart  1).  
As part of the October Budget 2022–23, the Government invested $4.6  billion to 
increase Child Care Subsidy rates to make early childhood education more  
affordable for eligible Australian families. In 2023 , child  care prices fell by 
7.2 per cent; without increases to the child  care subsidy , they would have risen by 
13.0 per cent. 
To alleviate  rental  pressures on low -income renters, the Government increase d the 
maximum rates of Commonwealth Rent Assistance by 15  per cent  at the 2023 –24 
Budget . This has reduced  CPI Rents  growth  by 1.7 percentage points through the 
year  to the March quarter 2024 . 
As households continue to face significant c ost-of living - pressures, the Government 
has expanded  electricity bill relief to all households  and provided further increases 
to maximum Commonwealth Rent Assistance rates as part of Budget 2024 –25. These 
two policies  are estimated to directly reduce  headline inflation by around ½ a 
percentage point in 2024 –25 and are not expected to add to broader inflationary 
pressures in the economy . 
Further cost -of-living relief is being delivered through a suite  of other policy changes 
as part of Budget 202 4–25. The Government ’s decision to redesign tax relief through 
its cost-of-living tax cuts  will provide relief to all 13.6 million taxpayers  and will not 
impact the inflation outlook .

The labour market  
The l abour market has so far proven to be highly resilient . The unemployment rate remains  
low by historical standards, employment growth has been  strong , and the participation  rate 
is near record highs  (Charts 2.22 and 2.23) . The strength in the labour market reflects strong 
business balance sheets  and the expansion of more labour -intensive sectors  of the economy .  
Despite this resilience, c onditions in the labour market have begun to gradually ease  and 
this is expected to continue over the coming year. To date, the moderation in the labour 
market has  mainly occurred through a reduction in a verage hours .  
Employment  is forecast to continue to grow, albeit at a more modest pace and by less than 
the growth  in the size of the labour force. Leading indicators of employment growth , such 
as job advertisements and vacancies , have  consistently  declined  from record highs in 
mid-2022 . This  is expected to  lead to  a gradual rise in the unemployment rate , which  is 
forecast to be 4½ per cent in the June quarter 2025. The participation rate is expected to 
decline modestly as easing labour market conditions discourage some workers from 
participating in the labour force. Even as labour market conditions ease , the unemployment 
rate will remain  low by historical standards  and is forecast to remain  below the 
pre-pandemic decade average of 5.5  per cent.

Nominal wages have picked up and are growing at the ir fastest rate in nearly 15  years . 
Nominal wages , as measured by the Wage Price Index (WPI ), grew by  4.2 per cent through 
the year to th e December quarter 2023  (Chart 2. 24). Wages  are expected to grow by 
4 per cent through the  year to the June quarter 2024.  There are no signs of a wage -price 
spiral developing and medium -term inflation expectations are well anchored .  
Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 2: Economic Outlook   |  Page 65 
The pick -up in wages has been broad -based across both the private and public sectors. The 
improvement in wage outcomes was initially driven by private sector wages . Administered 
wage decisions have supported the pick -up in private -sector  wage growth, particularly the 
Fair Work Commission ’s determinations on the minimum wage and the Aged Care Work 
Value Case . More recently, public  sector  wage outcomes have made a material contribution  
to wage growth . In both the public and private sector, multi-year enterprise agreements  
typically respond to higher inflation with a lag  and, therefore, are  expected to continue to 
support wage s growth over coming years.  
Administered wage decisions are expected to contin ue to support wage growth in the near 
term . The Government has recommended that the real wages of Australia ’s low -paid 
workers do not go backwards in its submission to the Fair Work Commission ’s Annual 
Wage Review . As a technical assumption, Treasury has a ssumed that the forthcoming F air 
Work Commission  determinations on both the Annual Wage Review and the aged care 
work value case are broadly consistent with the Government ’s submissions .  
Moving through 2024 –25, wage growth is expected to decline  as labour market conditions 
ease in line with aggregate demand. Growth in  wages set by  individual arrangements is 
moderating in line with the softening in  labour market conditions . Nominal  wage growth is 
expected to e ase to 3¼  per cent through the year to  the June quarter 2025 . 
The moderation  in inflation and higher nominal wage outcomes lifted real wages through 
the latter half of 2023. Annual real wages returned to growth at the end of 2023, which was 
earlier than ha d previously been  expected . Real wage growth is expected to rise to 
½ per cent by the June quarter 2024 (Chart  2.25).

Box 2. 3: Labour market resilience and employment opportunities  
Employment growth in Australia has been s tronger than any major advanced 
econom y over the past two years (Chart 1). Strong employment and strong growth 
in labour supply has translated into a pick -up in the employment -to-populat ion 
ratio . The share  of Austr alians  who have a job  is larger than in any major advanced 
econom y (Chart 2) . If the employment -to-population ratio was the same level as 
Canada, the most comparable  major economy to Australia, around 600,000 fewer 
Australians  would be employed.  
The resilient Australian labour market has provided employme nt opportunities for 
a broad section of the community, including cohorts that have traditionally faced 
barriers to employment. Youth and female employment -to-population ratios reached 
record highs over the past two years, while their respective unemploymen t rates 
reached record lows. Job attachment for these workers will have enduring benefits 
and ensure employment is more inclusive , despite the expected moderate rise in 
unemployment .

Statement 2: Economic Outlook   |  Page 67 
Outlook for the terms of trade  
Australia ’s terms of trade , the ratio of export to import prices, are forecast to decline by 
15 per cent over the next three  years . As the terms of trade are falling from a high level , 
they are  expected to stabilise to around the average level of the past 15 years in 2025–26. 
The decline in the terms of trade primarily reflects the assumption that bulk commodity 
export prices will trend to their long -run fundamental levels . Commodity prices are 
assumed to  reach their long -run anchors  over four quarters  by the end of March quarter 
2025  (Table  2.2).  
The outlook for the terms of trade is highly uncertain , reflecting  potential volatility in 
commodity prices. Recent developments in the outlook for demand for s teel in China  and 
a modest improvement in iron ore and metallurgical coal supply has driven a sharp 
correction in iron ore and metallurgical coal prices . Box 2.4 presents scenarios outlining the 
sensitivity of nominal GDP and  tax receipts to alternative bulk commodity price assumptions . 
Box 2. 4: Commodity prices  
Commodity prices have remained volatile over the past two years. Further volatility 
in the prices of Australia ’s bulk commodity exports remains a key source of 
uncertainty in the outlook for nominal GDP and Government tax receipts . This box 
explores the sensitivity of the outlook for nominal GDP and tax receipts to 
alternative near -term profiles for iron ore and metallurgical coal prices.  
Iron ore and metallurgical coal pri ces have been elevated over the past two years 
due to strong demand from China and disruptions to supply both in Australia and 
globally. However, recent indications suggest that steel demand in China has likely 
peaked and a recovery in the supply of iron o re and metallurgical coal has put 
downward pressure on prices.  
Chinese imports of iron ore reached record levels in 2023 in line with near -record 
steel production. This was due to strong  demand from investment in infrastructure, 
expanding industrial capaci ty and exports , which offset weak demand from 
property investment. However, as property sector demand is expected to remain 
weak, with residential construction starts in China having fallen to their lowest level 
in over 15  years, steel production has likel y passed its peak and is expected to ease in 
2024  (Chart  1). Coinciding with the weak outlook for demand, global supply of iron 
ore has improved with a recovery in Brazilian supply in recent months (Chart  2).

Two alternative price scenarios have been considered to assess the sensitivity of 
Budget forecasts to alternative profiles  for iron ore and metallurgical coal prices 
(Charts 3 and 4).   
• In the upside scenario, iron ore and metallurgical coal prices are as sumed to stay 
at their recent averages until the end of the September quarter 2024, after which 
they glide to their long -run anchor prices by the end of March quarter 2025.  
• In the downside scenario, iron ore and metallurgical coal prices fall to their 
long-run anchor prices by the end of the September quarter 2024.  
Compared with the Budget forecasts, nominal GDP is higher by $16.5  billion in the 
upside scenario and lower by $18.1  billion in the downside scenario over the 
forward estimates (Table 1). The le vel of company tax receipts is $4.1  billion higher 
in the upside scenario and $4.5  billion lower in the downside scenario over the 
forward estimates.

Outlook for nominal GDP  growth  
Nominal GDP is expected to grow 4¾ per cent in 2023 –24. This reflects underlying growth 
in economic output as well as strength in prices for domestic consumption and investment. 
Nominal GDP growth is then expected to slow to 2¾ per cent in 2024 –25, as high er output 
growth and domestic inflation  are offset by the fall in the terms of trade.   
Medium -term projections  
The fiscal aggregates are underpinned by economic forecasts over the forward  estimates 
period and projections over the medium term  (Chart 2. 26).

Treasury uses a macroeconometric model of the Australian economy for its forecasts and 
projections beyond the detailed forecast horizon of  2025–26. The model informs how the 
economy returns to its trend level of output, known as potential  GDP, following short -term 
fluctuations of the business cycle.  
Potential GDP is estimated based on an analysis of trends for population, productivity, and 
participation. Potential GDP growth is projected to average 2½  per cent per annum over the 
2028–29 to 203 4–35 projection period .  
Both the population (aged over 15) and the trend participation rate ha ve been revised up by 
¼ of a percent age point  by 203 4–35. The updated estimates for  population and its age 
structure are reflected in  trend participation.   
The upgrade in the size of the workforce has been offset by a lower estimated level of trend 
productivity in the near term . This reflects w eak underlying productivity growth, which 
pre-dated COVID -19 pandemic related disruptions that are largely expected  to unwind.  
In the long run, underlying productivity is assumed to grow at 1.2  per cent per annum . 
The unemployment rate settles at Treasury ’s Non -Accelerating Inflation Rate of 
Unemployment (NAIRU) assumption of 4¼  per cent by the June quarter 202 8 and 
remains  at that rate over the medium -term projection period.   
Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 2: Economic Outlook   |  Page 71 
Domestic price growth converges over time to the midpoint of the Reserve Bank of 
Australia ’s inflation target band of 2  to 3 per cent. The terms of trade are projected to 
remain around thei r 202 5–26 level over the medium term, with key commodity prices being 
at levels consistent with their long -term fundamentals. Nominal wage growth converges to 
around 3¾  per cent, reflecting the outlook for labour productivity growth and inflation.    
Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook   |  Page 73 Statement 3:  
Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  
Following a $22.1  billion surplus in 2022 –23, a $9.3  billion surplus is now forecast for  
2023 –24 – the first back -to-back surpluses in nearly two decades.  The Government ’s 
responsible economic and fiscal management has returned the budget to surplus faster than 
any major advanced economy.  
This Government is continuing to support monetary policy, keeping pressure off inflation 
by targeting a second surplus and returning  over 96  per cent of tax upgrades to the budget 
in 2023 –24. Since the Pre -election Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2022  (PEFO) , 82 per cent of 
tax upgrades have been  returned  to the budget over the forward estimates period.   
Real payments growth has been limited since coming to government and over the forward 
estimate s period to 1.4 per cent per year , compared to around 3.2  per cent over the past 
30 years.  The Government has identified $ 32.2 billion in budget improvements in this 
Budget , bringing the total to $ 104.8  billion since coming to government.   
The Government is delivering cost -of-living relief, with energy bill relief and rent assistance 
estimated to directly  reduce headline inflation by ½ of a percentage  point  in 2024 –25. This  
could see headline inflation return to the target band by the end of 2024, slightly earlier 
than expected  at the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO ). 
Inflation is the primary focus of the Budget in the near term. As inflation moderates, fiscal 
policy will shift  emphasis towards promoting sustainable economic growth and public 
finances  over time . This is achieved through a balanced approach that manages near -term 
risks to inflation and growth, puts in place reforms to build a stronger and  more resilient 
economy, and safeguards fiscal sustainability.   
The underlying cash balance forecast for  2023 –24 has improved by $10.5 billion since 
MYEFO and $65.9 billion since the PEFO. A deficit of $28.3 billion is forecast in 2024 –25. 
The larger deficit is driven by the Government ’s cost -of-living relief and addressing 
unavoidable spending pressures including the extension of funding for  terminating health 
measures and frontline services. The underlying cash balance has improved by a 
cumulative $214.7 billion  over the six  years to 2027 –28 compared to the forecasts at the 
PEFO . Gross debt is projected to be $183.0 billion lower at 30 June 20 25 than forecast in the 
PEFO, saving around $80 billion in interest costs over the decade .  
In line with the Economic and Fiscal Strategy, the Government is on track to stabilise and 
reduce gross debt as a share of the economy. Gross debt as a share of the economy is lower 
than at MYEFO and the PEFO in every year of the forward estimates and medi um term. 
Gross debt is projected to peak at 35.2  per cent of GDP at 30  June 2027, 9.7  percentage 
points lower than the peak forecast in the PEFO.  
The underlying cash balance improves over the medium term . However, Austral ia faces 
long‑term fiscal challenges due to climate change, an ageing population, regional security 
and rising demand for care and support services .

Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook   |  Page 77  Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  
The Government ’s responsible economic management has delivered a surplus in 2022 –23, 
and a second surplus of $9. 3 billion (0. 3 per cent of GDP) is forecast in 2023 –24 (Table  3.1). 
This is an improvement in 2023 –24 of $10. 5 billion since MYEFO and $65.9 billion since the 
PEFO .  
This Government is continuing to support monetary policy, keeping pressure off inflation 
by targeting a second surplus and  returning over 96  per cent of tax upgrades to the budget 
in 2023 –24. Since the PEFO, 82  per cent of tax upgrades have been returned to the budget 
over the forward estimates period.  
A deficit of $28.3  billion (1.0  per cent of GDP) is forecast in 2024 –25. The larger deficit is 
driven by the Government ’s cost -of-living relief and addressing unavoidable spending 
including the extension of funding for terminating health measures and frontline services.  
The upgrades to receipts in this Budget are muc h smaller than recent budget updates, at 
around a fifth of the average of the previous three Budgets. This Budget sees tax receipts, 
excluding GST and policy decisions, increasing by $ 8.2 billion in 2024 –25 and $27.0  billion 
over the forward estimates.  
Real payments growth has been limited since coming to government and over the forward 
estimate s period to 1.4  per cent and  2.1 per cent between 2024 –25 and 2027 –28, compared to 
around 3 .2 per cent over the past 30  years. The Government has identified $ 32.2 billion in 
budget improvements in this Budget, bringing the total to $ 104.8  billion since coming to 
government.  
The underlying cash balance is projected to improve over  the medium term . Gross debt  as 
a share of the economy  is projected to be lower than at MYEFO and PEFO in every year of 
the forward estimates and medium term, helping to rebuild fiscal buffe rs to prepare for 
future challenges.  
Gross debt as a share of the economy is expected to peak one year earlier and 
0.2 percentage point s lower than projected in MYEFO.  By 30  June  2034, gross debt is 
31.5 per cent of GDP, 0.6 percentage points lower than projected at MYEFO . Gross debt is 
projected to be $183.0 billion lower at 30 June 2025  than at PEFO, and these improvements 
save around $80  billion in interest costs over the decade.    |  Budget Paper No. 1

Economic and Fiscal Strategy  
The Government ’s Economic and Fiscal Strategy is making the economy and the budget 
stronger, more resilient and more sustainable over the medium term (Box  3.1). The strategy 
is consistent with the requirements of the Charter of Budget Honesty Act  1998 , with progress 
reviewed each budget update.   
Box 3.1: The Government ’s Economic and Fiscal Strategy  
The Government ’s Economic and Fiscal  Strategy will make the economy more 
resilient and put the budget on a more sustainable footing over time.  
The Strategy  is focused on the objectives of strong, inclusive and sustainable 
economic growth, full employment, growing real wages, ensuring women ’s 
economic participation and equality, and improving living standards for all 
Australians.  
The Government will improve the budget position in a measured way, consistent 
with the overarching goal of reducing gross debt as a share of the economy over 
time. This approach enables fiscal policy to respond to changes in economic 
conditions to support macroeconomic stability, including in times of high inflation.  
These objectives will be achieved by investments that grow the economy and expand 
productive capacity , and budget discipline that restrains spending growth and 
enhances the quality of spending. The budget will be improved in a manner 
consistent with the objective of maintaining full employment, while continuing to 
deliver essential services.  
Putting the budget on a more sustainable footing will ensure the Government has the 
fiscal buffers to withstand economic shocks and better manage the fiscal pressures 
from an ageing population and climate change.  
These commitments will be underpinned by the following  elements:  
• Allowing tax receipts and income support to respond in line with changes in the 
economy and directing the majority of improvements in tax receipts to budget 
repair.  
• Limiting growth in spending until gross debt as a share of GDP is on a 
downward s trajectory, while growth prospects are sound and unemployment  
is low.  
• Improving the efficiency, quality and sustainability of spending.  
• Focusing new spending on investments and reforms that build the capability of 
our people, expand the productive capaci ty of our economy, and support action 
on climate change.  
• Delivering a tax system that funds government services in an efficient, fair and 
sustainable way.    |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 80  |  Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  
Delivering on the Economic and Fiscal Strategy  
This Budget delivers on the Government ’s Economic and Fiscal Strategy by:  
• Forecasting a $ 9.3 billion surplus in 2023 –24 – this would be  the first time a government 
has delivered  back -to-back surpluses in nearly two decades  (Chart 3.1) . 
• Reducing debt as a share of the economy over time. Gross debt -to-GDP is projected to 
peak at 35.2  per cent at 30 June 2027 , before declining to 30.2 per cent at 30  June  2035 
(Chart 3.2) . 
• Returning 9 6 per cent of tax receipt upgrades (excluding GST) to the budget in 2023 –24, 
keeping pressure of f inflation.   
• Returning 82 per cent of revenue upgrades to the budget since coming to government  
over the forward estimates period .  
• Repairing the budget through $27.9  billion in savings and spending reprioritisations 
and $ 3.1 billion in improvements to the tax system.   
– This brings total savings and spending reprioritisation s to $77.4  billion and total 
budget improveme nts to $104.8  billion since the PEFO.   
• Limiting spending, with real payments growth since coming to government and over 
the forward estimate s period estimated to be 1.4  per cent.  
– This compares to the 3.2  per cent average o ver the past 30  years.

Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook   |  Page 81 
The Government is keeping the pressure off inflation and supporting monetary policy by 
targeting a second consecutive surplus and continuing to bank the majority of revenue 
upgrades in 2023 –24 (Box 3.2 ). The Government is directly reducing inflation through 
respo nsible cost of living measures. In 2024 –25, extension  of energy bill relief and increases 
to rental assistance  are estimated to directly reduce inflation by ½ of a percentage point and 
are not expected to add to broader inflationary pressures.  
Compared to the PEFO:  
• The underlying cash balance has improved by a cumulative $ 214.7  billion over the six 
years to 2027 –28.  
• Gross debt is lower every year of the projection period. At 30 June 2025 , gross debt is 
projected to be $183 .0 billion (11.0 percentage points of GDP) lower than at the  PEFO.  
• The improvements to the Budget  position over the 11 years to 2032 –33 are expected to 
save around $80  billion in interest payments over this period .  
The Government ’s responsible economic and fiscal management has meant Australia ’s 
fiscal position  has improved by more than any other  G20 country  since 2021 . Australia 
remains one of only nine countries to retain a AAA credit rating from all three major credit 
rating agencies.    |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 82  |  Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  
Box 3.2: Fiscal policy in a period  of high inflation  
In a high -inflation environment, fiscal policy  can be used to reduce demand 
pressures while providing targeted cost-of-living support to those in need . This can 
help ease inflation and limit the adverse impact on household consumption and 
welfare relative to monetary policy working alone  (IMF 2023).  
In Australia, fiscal policy has tightened rapidly . Budget balance metrics – such as the 
underlying cash balance and net operating balance (as a  per cent of GDP) – have 
increased by around seven  percentage points since their pandemic trough . This is 
the fastest and largest tightening on record: typical improvements were around two 
to three  percentage points in the three years coming out of recessions (Chart 3. 3).

Note:  Cumulative underlying cash balance improvement  over three years from the trough 
following an economic downturn.  
 
This tightening  was possible because of the Government ’s spending restraint, 
through returning the majority of upward revisions to tax receipts  to the budget and 
keeping real spending growth low.

Box 3.2: Fiscal Policy in a Period of High Inflation  (continued)  
Economic strength, a resilient labour market and high commodity prices drove an 
increase in personal income and company tax collections. This saw large upward 
revisions to tax receipts as the Australian economy rebounded from the pand emic.  
Returning 91  per cent of tax receipt upgrades to the budget in 2022 –23 and 2023 –24 
has allowed these improvements in receipts to help moderate demand in the 
economy. If the upgrades were instead spent, the underlyin g cash balance would be 
around 3  per cent of GDP worse in 2023 –24 (Chart 3.4).

Spending restraint – including by not continuing to extend temporary pandemic 
fiscal measures or replacing them with new spending measures – and structural 
budget improvements further added to the fiscal tightening.  
Within a tightening budget position, the  Government provided responsible relief to 
support households facing significant cost -of-living pressures. The impacts of high 
but moderating inflation and higher interest rates put households under pressure. In 
response, the Government undertook measures – including energy bill relief, child 
care subsidies, and rent assistance – to support households to pay for essentials.  
By tightening fiscal policy in aggregate and providing responsible relief in the 
period of high inflation, the Government’s approach t o fiscal policy has helped to 
reduce inflation from its peak while reducing the burden of inflation on lower and 
middle -income households.     |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 84  |  Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  
Fiscal outlook  
Underlying cash balance estimates  
The underlying cash balance is estimated to be a $9. 3 billion surplus (0. 3 per cent of GDP) 
in 2023 –24, an improvement of $10. 5 billion compared to MYEFO  (Table  3.2). This follows a 
$22.1  billion surplus in 2022 –23. This would be the first back -to-back surplus nearly two 
decades . Australia ’s fiscal position has improve d by more than any other G20 country since 
2021, according to IMF data (Box 3.3).  
An underlying cash deficit of $ 28.3 billion (1.0  per cent of GDP) is forecast for 2024 –25, 
$9.5 billion lower since MYEFO. The underlying cash deficit is expected to increase in  
2025 –26 before declining to $24. 3 billion (0.8  per cent of GDP) in 2027 –28. Over the 
five years to 2027 –28, the underlying cash balance is lower by a cumulative $ 11.8 billion  
since MYEFO .  
Policy decisions since MYEFO have reduced the underlying cash balance by $24. 4 billion 
over five  years to 2027 –28. This includes  $7.8 billion dollars in responsible cost -of-living 
relief  and $15.4  billion in unavoidable spending.  Parameter and other variations since 
MYEFO have improved the underlying cash balance by $ 12.6 billion over five years to 
2027 –28. 
Addressing Unavoidable and Legacy Issues  
Over  five years to 2027 –28, there is $15.4 billion in unavoidable spending , including  to 
extend terminating programs and continue to address legacy issues left by the former 
Government. Investment in these critical areas ensures that we keep existing programs in 
place to prevent any cuts to the services that Australians rely on. This inclu des funding to :  
• address pressures at Services Australia, help stabilise claim processing performance and 
continue emergency response capability, continue to operate, maintain and enhance 
myGov, and improve safety for staf f and customers.   
• address unavoidable cost pressures for existing projects in the Infrastructure 
Investment  Program.   
• extend  terminating health programs and continue the COVID -19 response.   
• support digital capability and sustainment of aged care systems.  
• address underfunding at Home Affairs and the Australia n Border Force, helping to 
sustain operations and maintain capability to secure our borders.

Box 3. 3: International fiscal comparisons  
The Government ’s responsible budget management, where the proceeds from a 
resilient  labour market and elevated commodity prices have been returned to the 
budget, has contributed to  strong fiscal outcomes for Australia.  Australia ’s budget 
balance as a share of GDP has continued to improve more quickly th an in most 
countries , and gross debt -to-GDP remains at comparatively low levels.  
Australia ’s general government fiscal deficit – which includes the fiscal positions of 
state and local governments – is expected to have narrowed to 0.9  per cent of GDP 
in 2023, from 6.5  per cent in 2021. This 5.6  percentage point improvement is much 
larger than the advanced -economy average of 1.6  percentage points over the same 
period (Chart 3.5). Australia had the second strongest fiscal balance in 2023 among 
G20 countries, up from fourteenth in 2021.

Debt -to-GDP has fallen faster and earlier than the IMF projected at the height of 
the pandemic. Between 2021 and 2023, Australia ’s general government gross 
debt -to-GDP fell by 6.1 percentage points. Australia ’s gross debt as a share of GDP 
has remained low  compared to its international peers (Chart 3.6).

Box 3.3: International Fiscal Comparisons (continued)  
The recent debt reduction is a welcome development. However, across the world, 
government debt remains well above its pre -Global Financial Crisis levels. In 
Australia, general government gross debt increased to a peak of 57  per cent in 2020. 
The Government ’s Economic and Fiscal Strategy focuses on reducing gross debt as 
a share of the economy. The IMF projects Australia ’s general government gross debt 
to GDP to continue to fall to 44  per cent of GDP by 2029. This will ensure Australia 
continues to have the fiscal space to respond to future economic shocks.

Page 88  |  Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  
Primary balance estimates  
The primary cash balance adjusts the underlying cash balance to exclude interest payments 
and interest receipts  (as these are largely  outside government control in the short term). 
This provides  a more representative measure of the Government ’s fiscal decisions.  
The primary balance is expected to be in surplus by $21.6 billion ( 0.8 per cent of GDP) 
in 2023–24 and in deficit in 2024–25. In 2027 –28, the primary balance is expected to return to 
surplus , reflecting an improv ing underlying cash balance .  
Since MYE FO, the primary balance has improved $ 10.1 billion in 202 3–24 and deteriorated 
by $9.9 billion in 202 4–25. Movements in the primary balance ov er the forward estimates 
period  are broadly consistent with movements in the underlying cash balance . 
The underlying cash balance is expected to  improve more than the primary balance in 
2023 –24 because net interest payments (which are excluded from the primary balance 
calculation) are lower than forecast at MYEFO.   
   
Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook   |  Page 89 
Medium -term projections  
The medium -term fiscal outlook has slightly improved  since the 2023 –24 M YEFO . Modest 
underlying cash deficits of less than 1 per cent of GDP are project ed over the medium term .  
• The underlying cash balance in 2033–34 is expected to be a deficit of  0.2 per cent of GDP, 
a 0.1 percentage point  improvement over that  projected at MYEFO .  
• The primary balance is expected to be in surplus from 2029–30. The primary surplus 
in 2033–34 is expected to be 0.9 per cent of GDP,  0.1 percentage points higher than 
projected  at MYEFO . 
• Gross debt -to-GDP is lower across the entire projection period compared to MYEFO. 
By 30 June  2034, gross debt is expected to be 31.5 per cent of GDP, 0.6 percentage points 
lower than projected at MYEFO.  
Total receipts as a share of GDP are expected to increase from 25.2 per cent of GDP in 
2027 –28 to 26.2 per cent of GDP in 203 4–35. Total payments as a share of GDP are expected 
to increase from 26.0 per cent of GDP in 2027 –28 to 26.3 per cent of GDP  in 203 4–35 
(Chart  3.7).

Changes in the medium -term outlook since MYEFO  
Receipts as a share of GDP are lower  since MYEFO , including  0.1 percentage points lower 
in 2033–34.  
Payments are expected to be 0.3 percentage points of GDP lower than at MYEFO in  
2033 –34. Nominal GDP is also higher than at MYEFO, reducing receipts and payments as 
a share of the economy.   
Payment s over  the medium -term  
The fastest -growing major payments over the me dium  term are interest on government 
debt, the National Disability Insurance Scheme ( NDIS ), defence, health and aged care. 
Growth in  some of these payme nts has changed since MYEFO (Chart 3. 8).  
• Interest payments growth is expected to average 9.9 per cent per year  over the 
projections period (2024 –25 to 2034 –35) compared to 11.7  per cent at MYEFO  (2023 –24 to 
2033 –34).  
• NDIS Commonwealth  funded participant payments growth is expected to average 
9.2 per cent per year  over the projections period compared to 10.1 per cent at MYEFO . 
This largely reflects the shifting of the end of the projection period to 2034 –35, which 
encompasses an additional year of moderation in scheme  growth under the NDIS 
Financial Sustainability Framework . The Government ’s NDIS reforms are expected to 
moderate  growth in NDIS expenditure from 2024 –25 in line with  MYEFO projections.    
• Defence payments growth is expected to average 6.6 per cent per year  over the 
projection period compared to 6.3  per cent at MYEFO. This reflects  the introduction of 
the 2024 National Defence Strategy , which  will increase defence payments  as a share of 
GDP over the next decade  (Box 3. 4).  
• Medical benefits payments growth is expected to be 5.7 per cent on average over the 
projection period , broadly similar  to the 5.9 per cent at  MYEFO.

Box 3.4: Investing in our national defence  
The Government is investing an additional $50.3  billion over the next decade, 
through the 2024 National Defence Strategy (NDS) to meet Australia ’s strategic 
needs . Defence ’s Integrated Investment Program has been rebuilt as part of the NDS 
to accelerate delivery of capability priorities, including the expansion of the Royal 
Australian Navy ’s surface combatant fleet. Defence funding will be higher in every 
year of the forward estimates and o ver the medium  term compared to MYEFO and  
the PEFO (Chart 3. 9). Total investment in defence will amount to  $765  billion across 
2024 –25 to 2033 –34.   
The Government is reforming the Department of Defence ’s capability acquisition 
system to deliver capability more quickly while maximising value for money, 
transparency, and appropriate assurance mechanisms to support implementation of 
the NDS.  
These investments and reforms will shift the Australian Defence Force to an 
integrated  and focused force, strengthen cooperation with international partners , 
and enhance  our capacity to address the complex strategic circumstances we face .

Receipts estimates and projections  
Total receipts are expected to decrease from 25.8 per cent of GDP in 202 3–24 to 25.2 per cent 
of GDP in 202 7–28. This largely reflects changes in tax receipts, which are expected to 
decrease from 23.8 per cent of GDP to 23.3 per cent of GDP over this period (Chart 3. 10).

Policy decisions in this Budget have increased total receipts by $ 2.2 billion in 202 4–25 since 
MYEFO, and by $ 8.1 billion over five years to 202 7–28.  
Policy decisions since MYEFO have increased tax receipts by $ 4.9 billion over five years to

Key tax receipt measures include:  
• delivering a tax cut for all 13.6  million Australian taxpayers from 1  July 2024 . This 
measure is estimated to decrease receipts by $1.3  billion over the five years to 2027 –28 
• extending the ATO ’s Tax Avoidance Taskforce, Shadow Economy Compliance Program  
and Personal Income Tax Compliance Program. These measures are estimated to 
increase receipts by $ 4.5 billion over the five years to 2027–28, partially offset by an 
associated increase in payments of $ 1.8 billion, including GST payments to the states 
and territories of $ 0.4 billion  
• strengthening the integrity of the foreign resident capital gains tax regime . This measure 
is estimated to increase receipts by $600  million over the five years to 2027 –28, parti ally 
offset by an associated increase in payment s of $8.0 million.     |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 94  |  Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  
Since MYEFO, policy decisions are expected to increase non -tax receipts by $0.5  billion in 
2024 –25 and by $3.2  billion over the five years to 2027 –28.  
Further details of Government policy decisions are provided in Budget Paper No.  2, 
Budget  Measures 2024–25.  
Receipts parameter and othe r variations over the forward estimates  
Parameter and other variations have increased total receipts since MYEFO  by $6.9 billion in 
2023 –24, $5.5 billion in 2024 –25 and by $ 23.8 billion over five years to 2027 –28 (Table 3.3) . 
The increase in total receipts due t o parameter and other variations primarily reflects tax 
receipts, which have been revised up by $ 7.3 billion in 2024 –25 and by $ 21.1 billion over 
five years to 2027 –28.  
This Budget sees tax receipts excluding GST and policy decisions, increasing since MYEFO 
by $8.2 billion in 2024 –25 and $27.0 billion over the forward estimates period. Higher 
employment and continuing strength in the labour market is a key driver of upgra des, 
accounting for $21.6 billion of the net  $27.0  billion upgrade to tax receipts since MYEFO. 
Higher corporate profits make a broadly similar contribution to the upgrade to tax receipts. 
These have been partly offset by a weaker than expected outlook for  tobacco excise and 
superannuation fund earnings.   
Since MYEFO, parameter and other variations are expected to decrease non -tax receipts by 
$1.8 billion in 2024 –25 and increase non -tax receipts by $5.6  billion over the fi ve years to 
2027 –28. This movement is partially driven by  the Commonwealth Superannuation 
Corporation reprofiling the transfer of funded benefits to the Consolidated Revenue Fund , 
higher earnings from the Future Fund and Australian Government Investment Funds , and 
higher interest on cash deposits.   
Further information on expected receipts is provided in Statement 5:  Revenue. Analysis of 
the sensitivity of the receipts estimates to changes in the economic outlo ok is provided in 
Statement 8: Forecasting Performance and Sensitivity Analysis .  
Payments estimates and projections  
Since MYEFO , total projected payments have decreased  by $3.4 billion in 2023 –24 and  
increased by  $43.7 billion over five years to 2027 –28. Real payments growth since coming to 
government and over the forward estimates period is expected to be 1.4 per cent per year.  
Payments due to parameter and other variations  have been revised down by $3.7 billion in 
2023 –24, largely  arising from delays in payments as a result of  capacity constraints.  
Payments as a share of GDP are lower from 2027 –28 and in every year of the medium term  
compared to MYEFO.  By 2034 –35, payments are projected to be 26.3 per cent of GDP 
(Chart  3.11).

Payment policy decisions over the forward estimates  
New policy decisions since MYEFO have increased total payments by $11.7  billion in  
2024 –25 and by $32.5  billion over five  years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28.  
Major policy decisions since MYEFO that have increased payments include:  
• the delivery of the 2024 National Defence Strategy and Integrated Investment Program, 
which is expected to increase payments  by $5.7  billion over four years from 2024 –25   
• the extension and expansion of the Energy Bill Relief Fund to provide cost of livin g 
relief to all Australian households and eligible small businesses, which is expected to 
increase payments by $3.5 billion over three years from 2023 –24  
• funding for new and amended listing on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which is 
expected to increase payments by $3.4  billion over five years from 2023 –24   
• funding towards priority road and rail infrastructure projects, consistent with the 
Government ’s more integrated, strategic and sustainable approach to infrastructure 
investment, which is expected to increase payments by $2.9 billion over five years from 
2023 –24  
• funding to improve the way Services Australia delivers services to the Australian 
commu nity, by maintaining frontline staff, enhancing safety and security at Services 
Australia centres and sustaining  and enhancing the myGov platform, which is expected 
to increase payments by $2.8  billion over five years from 2023 –24    |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 96  |  Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  
• the delivery of the Gove rnment ’s Future Made in Australia agenda, which makes it 
easier to invest in Australia and promotes  investment in key priority industries, 
including Australia ’s plan to become a renewable energy superpower, and investing in 
new digital capabilities, which is expected to increase payments by $ 2.6 billion over 
five years from 2023 –24   
• funding to continue aged care reforms, including in response to the Royal Commission 
into Aged Care Quality and Safety, which is expected to increase payments by 
$2.2 billion over five years from 2023 –24  
• increases to the maximum rates of Commonwealth  Rent Assistance by 10 per cent to 
help address rental affordability challenges for  recipients, which is expected to increase 
payments by $1.9 billion over five years from 2023 –24  
• increased investment in housing infrastructure to build more homes sooner, and 
support for social housing and homelessness services by states and territories under a 
new  National Agreement on Social Housing and Homelessness, which is expected  to 
increase payments by $1. 5 billion over seven years from 2023 –24   
• funding to strengthen Medicare by supporting earlier discharge from hospital for older 
Australians, improving access to essential services, modernising Australia ’s digital 
health infrast ructure, and ensuring the integrity of Medicare, which is expected to 
increase payments by $1.1  billion over five years from 2023 –24 
• strengthening of Australia ’s government -funded Paid Parental Leave scheme to 
improve women ’s retirement outcomes, which is expected to increase payments by 
$1.1 billion  over five years from 2023 –24   
• funding for the first stage of reforms to Australia ’s tertiary education system to boost 
equity and access to higher education, progress tertiary harmonisation and drive future 
productivity growth, which is expected to increase payments by $ 667.6 million over 
five years from 2023 –24   
Major policy decisions since MYEFO that have decreased payments include:  
• moderating the growth in NDIS participant support  payments by $14.4 billion over four 
years from 2024 –25, through the NDIS legislative reforms being undertaken by the 
Government as part of the National Disability Insurance Scheme – Getting the NDIS back on 
track  measure, which will offset the expected increase in expenditure on supports for 
NDIS participants from 2024 –25 based on the revised projections from the NDIS 
Actuary (see payment parameter and other variations below)  
• further reducing spending on consultan ts, contractors and labour hire, will achieve a 
savings of $1.0 billion over four years from 2024 –25 
• funding for additional activities to strengthen the payment and accuracy of the  Child 
Care Subsidy  program, will achieve savings of $ 440.7 million over fou r years from  
2024 –25.

Payment parameter and other variations over the forward estimates  
Parameter and other variations since MYEFO have increased payments by $5.5  billion in 
2024 –25 and by $11.2 billion over five years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28.  
This is primarily driven by higher estimates for payments related to the NDIS and for 
payments to v eterans under the Military Rehabilitation Compensation Acts as the 
Government delivers on its commitment to clear the claims backlog. Offsetting this 
increase, in part, are an estimated decrease in GST payments to the states, a decrease in 
payments related  to the Medical Benefits program, and lower expected recipient numbers 
for the Financial Support for Carers and Student Payments programs , reflecting continued 
strong labour market performance . 
Major increases in payments from parameter and other variation s since MYEFO include:   
• payments related to the NDIS were estimated to increase by $1.3 billion in 2023 –24 and 
$15.9 billion over five years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28 based on revised projections from 
the NDIS Actuary showing increased expenditure on support s for NDIS participants, as 
well as other accounting adjustments. The NDIS legislative reforms being undertaken 
by the Government as part of the  National Disability Insurance Scheme – Getting the NDIS 
back on  track  measure are expected to offset the increase projected by the NDIS Actuary 
and moderate this additional growth in NDIS payments by $14.4 billion over four years 
from 2024 –25. Taken together, payments related to the NDIS are expected to increase by 
$1.5 bil lion over five years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28 and will ensure the NDIS remains 
on track to achieve the NDIS Sustainability Framework agreed by National Cabinet 
from 1  July 2026.  
• payments related to the Military Rehabilitation Compensation Acts – Income Supp ort 
and Compensation program are expected to increase by $892.7 million in 2024 –25 and 
$6.5 billion over five years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28, largely due to more claims being 
processed because of increased staffing levels that the Government has agreed to i n 
order to deliver on its commitment to clear the backlog, which results in increased 
payments to veterans.  
• payments related to National Partnership Payments – Natural Disaster Relief are 
expected to increase by $814.0 million in 2024 –25 and $3.9 billion  over five years from 
2023 –24 to 2027 –28, largely due to higher -than -expected spending related to past 
disaster events including New South Wales flooding events between March 2021 and 
September 2022 and flooding associated with Tropical Cyclone Jasper in 
December  2023 .  
• payments related to the Child Care Subsidy are expected to increase by $621.1  million in 
2024 –25 and $3.2 billion  over five years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28, largely reflecting 
additional support flowing to families due to the higher costs of pro viding care .   |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 98  |  Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  
• payments related to Job Seeker Income Support are expected to increase by 
$496.6  million in 2024 –25 and $2.7 billion over five years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28, 
largely due to upward revisions to the expected number of recipients and average 
paym ent rates driven by changes to the composition of payment recipients.  
• payments related to the Research and Development Tax Incentive are expected to 
increase by $499.0  million in 2024 –25 and $2.6  billion over five years from 2023 –24 to 
2027 –28. This is due  to increases in the overall number and value of expected claims, 
with higher -than -expected growth in claims by companies in the ‘Professional, Scientific 
and Technical Services ’ sector.  
• payments related to Defence Force Superannuation Benefits payments are expected to 
increase by $414.9  million in 2024 –25 and $2.1  billion over five years from 2023 –24 to 
2027 –28, largely reflecting changes to invalidity payment projections by the actuary for 
the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme and to align the accounting treatment 
of Defence superannuation schemes with whole -of-government arrangements.  
• payments relating to Non Government Schools are expected to increase by 
$136.7  million in 2024 –25 and $1.7  billion over five years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28, 
primarily due to revisions to enrolment projections.  
• payments related to Public Sector Superannuation Benefits are expected to increase by 
$325.7  million in 2024 –25 and $1.6  billion over five years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28, 
largely reflecting Consumer P rice Index (CPI) outcomes.  
• payments relating to Government Schools are expected to increase by $209.0  million in 
2024 –25 and $1.1 billion over five years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28, largely reflecting an 
increase in the number of students eligible to attract a ‘student with a disability ’ 
loading .  
Major decreases in payments from parameter and other variations since  MYEFO include:  
• payments related to the provision of GST to the states and territories (including 
Horizontal Fiscal Equalisation transition payment s) are expected to decrease by 
$987.8  million in 2024 –25 and $3.5 billion over five years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28. 
The decline in payments is a result of a decline in GST receipts, driven by lower 
discretionary consumption.  
• payments related to the Medical Benefits Program are expected to decrease by 
$390.0  million in 2024 –25 and $1.3  billion over five years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28, 
largely reflecting lower -than -projected demand for medical services.  
• payments relating to some road transport projects under the Infrastructure Investment 
Program are expected to decrease by $513.5 million in 2024 –25 and $1.2  billion over 
five years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28, to align with revised project delivery schedules and 
construction market conditions. This decrease i s more than offset by decisions which 
have increased funding over the forward estimates by $1.3  billion.

Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook   |  Page 99 
• payments related to Financial Support for Carers are expected to decrease by 
$122.4  million in 2024 –25 and $1.1 billion over five years from 2023 –24 to  2027 –28, 
largely due to lower -than -expected recipient numbers, reflecting continued strong 
labour market performance.  
• payments related to Student Payments are expected to decrease by $193.3  million in 
2024 –25 and $903.2 million over five years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28, largely due to a 
decrease in student numbers and average payment rates, reflecting continued strong 
labour market performance.  
• payments related to Parents Income Support are expected to decrease by $134.8  million 
in 2024 –25 and $639.5  million  over five years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28, largely due to 
lower -than -expected growth in recipient numbers reflecting a decline in recipients with 
a youngest child aged under 7  years old and a slightly lower -than -expected number of 
parents taking up the expa nded Parenting Payment (Single ).  
• payments related to Paid Parental Leave are expected to decrease by $92.1 million  in 
2024 –25 and $ 521.3  million over five years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28, largely reflecting a 
reduction in expected recipient numbers driven b y lower -than -expected births.  
Consistent with past budgets, the underlying cash balance has been improved by regular 
draw down of the conservative bias allowance. Details in Statement 6: Expenses and Net

Headline cash balance estimates  
The headline cash balance adjusts the underlying cash balance to include net cash flows 
from investments in financial assets for poli cy purposes. This includes Specialist 
Investment Vehicles which  inves t in projects that deliver public value and a financial return 
to taxpayers . For example, Clean Energy Finance Corporation loans reduce the headline 
cash balance but not the underlying cash balance. Table  3.4 provides details of differences 
between the underlying and headline cash balance estimates.  
A headline cash deficit  of $47.2 billion is estimated in 2024 –25, compared to an estimated 
deficit of $ 32.9 billion in MYEFO . The  lower  headline cash balance compared to MYEFO  is 
primarily driven by the change  in the underlying cash balance. The headline cash balance 
moderates  to an est imated deficit of $ 42.0 billion ( 1.3 per cent of GDP) in 2027 –28. 
Estimates for total net cash outflows from investments in financial assets for policy 
purposes increased  by $11.6 billion over four years from 2023 –24 to 2026 –27 compared to 
MYEFO. This is primarily driven by additional equity and a loan provided to Snowy 
Hydro Limited and an increase in concessional finance for social and affordable housing 
projects from  Housing Aus tralia.  
Net cash  flows from student loans are expected to improve by $ 1.5 billion over the four 
years to 2026 –27 compared to MYEFO. This largely reflects increased  voluntary  loan 
repayment forecasts , partially offset by the lower repayments  resulting from reduced  
indexation under  the 2024 –25 Budget  measure Australian Universities Accord – tertiary 
education system reform s.

The Government ’s balance sheet  
The balance sheet measures the value of the Government ’s assets and liabilities. Changes in 
the balance sheet reflect movements in the underlying cash balance, additional balance 
sheet commitments, and market valuation effects including from changes in yields.  
Different balance sheet metrics measure different groupings of assets and liabilities.  
• Gross debt  measures the face value of Australian  Government Securities (AGS) on 
issue. This is the amount that the Government pays back to investors at maturity, 
independent of fluctuations in market prices.  
• Net debt  is measured at market value and incorpora tes specific financial assets and 
liabilities and provides a broader measure of the financial obligations of

• Net financial worth  is the sum of all financial assets less all financial liabilities. 
The assets of the Future Fun d and the public sector superannuation liability that the 
Future  Fund will finance are included in net financial worth.  
• Net worth  is the sum of all assets less all liabilities. It includes non –financial assets such 
as buildings and plant, equipment, and in frastructure.

Gross debt estimates and projections  
The Government ’s responsible budget management is lowering  debt  as a share of the 
economy compared to  MYEFO  and the PEFO  in every  year of the forward estimates period  
and medium term.   
Gross debt is estimated to be 33.7 per cent of GDP ($ 904.0 billion) at 30  June  2024, 
0.3 percentage points  lower than the estimate of 34.0 per cent of GDP ($ 909.0 billion ) at 
MYEFO . This primarily reflects the 2023 –24 underlying cash surplus and lower yields on 
debt. The gross debt -to-GDP position also benefits from upgrades to nominal GDP.  
In line with the Economic and Fiscal Strategy, the Government is on track to stabilise and 
reduce gross debt as a share of the economy. Gross debt is now projected to peak at 
35.2 per cent of GDP at 30 June  2027, 0.2 percentage points lower and one year earlier  than 
the peak at MYEFO . Gross debt is then projected to  decline  to 30.2 per cent at 30  June  2035 . 
Over the forward estimates  period , bond yields are assumed to remain fixed at a recent 
average of daily spot rates at the time of the budget update. Since MYEFO , the assumed 
weighted average cost of borrowing  for future issuance of Treasury Bonds has decreased 
from 4.7 to 4.2 per cent. This remains significantly above the 2.2  per cent at the PEFO.   |  Budget Paper No. 1

Information  on the impact of movements in yields on the underlying cash balance and 
gross debt  is provided in Statement 8 : Forecasting Performance and Sensitivity Analysis . 
Total i nterest payments are estimated to be 0.9 per cent of GDP in 202 4–25 before rising to 
1.3 per cent of GDP by 2034 –35.  
Further  information on government debt,  yield assumptions and interest payments  are 
provided in Statement  7: Debt Statement .  
Net debt estimates and projections  
Net debt is estimated to be 20.0 per cent of GDP ($ 552.5 billion) at 30  June  2025 (Table  3.5); 
slightly  higher than the estimate of 19.5 per cent of GDP ($ 533.3  billion) at MYEFO . 
The increase  since MYEFO primarily reflects the increase in the market value of existing 
debt  resulting from lower yields on government debt . Yields have fallen since MYEFO , 
making the fixed income stream from existing bonds relatively more attractive to investors. 
This increases the market value of existing bonds and hence net debt .  
Net debt remains higher than estimated at MYEFO over the entire projection period . Net 
debt is projected to be 18.7 per cent of GDP at 30  June  2035 (Chart  3.12).

Net financial worth and net worth estimates and projections  
Net financial worth is estimated to be minus  27.7 per cent of GDP (minus $ 764.5  billion) at 
30 June  2025 (Table  3.5), compared with the estimate of minus 26.9 per cent of GDP (minus 
$733.6  billion) at MYEFO .  
Net financial worth is projected to deteriorate to minus 27.9 per cent of GDP at 30  June  2028 
before improving to minus 20.6  per cent of GDP  at 30 June 2035  (Chart  3.13).

Net worth is estimated to b e minus 19.8 per cent of GDP (minus $ 545.1  billion) at 
30 June  2025 (Table  3.5), compared  with the estimate of minus 18.7 per cent of GDP 
(minus  $510.3  billion) at MYEFO .  
Net worth is projected to deteriorate to minus 20.7 per cent of GDP at 30 June  2026 before 
improving over the medium term.   
The reduction  in net worth and net financial worth over the forward estimates period 
relative to MYEFO largely reflects an increase in the market value of existing debt  due to 
lower bond yields  and an upward revision to the value of the G overnment ’s unfunded 
superannuation liability .  
Net worth and net financial worth as a share of the economy increase  over the medium 
term as debt -to-GDP is reduced .

Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook   |  Page 107 
Fiscal impacts of the net zero transformation  
Climate change and global climate action will have profound impacts on the economy, 
reshaping Australia ’s industry mix and requiring effective mitigation and adaptation to 
manage climate impacts like more severe bushfires and floods. At the same time , the 
renewable energy economic transformation is well underway. It will continue  to drive  
down energy costs and has the potential to help traditional and emerging industries 
compete internationally. Other sectors are also transforming as demand from domestic 
consumers and export destinations shifts to more sustainable products .  
This net zero transformation  presents opportunities for Australia ’s economy, regions, 
industries, and communities. Achieving Australia ’s emissions reduction commitments and 
realising the opportunities that accompany the transition will require significant 
investment by governments and the private sector.  
Uncertainty about t he physical impacts of climate change and the global transition to net 
zero emissions poses risks to the fiscal outlook . The global energy transition will bring new 
opportunities. Industries and jobs emerging from the net zero transformation will impact 
the structure of the economy and, in turn, the tax base. At the same time, the physical 
impacts of climate change and the associated cost for communities, business and 
government remain uncertain.  
The 2 024–25 Budget continues the practice introduced in the October 2022 –23 and 
May  2023 –24 Budgets of transparently reporting new climate -related spending, and 
builds  on these budgets by further reporting on new spending that enables the net zero 
transformation. In the 2024 –25 Budget there is $ 5.0 billion in net zero spending 
commitments over the forward estimates period and $ 24.3 billion over the medium term. 
This is in addition to the $4.6  billion in new climate -related spending announced in the 
May  2023 –24 Budget and the historic $24.9  billion in new climate -related spending 
announced in the October 2022 –23 Budget.  
The Government ’s approach to reporting climate -related spending is informed by the 
climate  reporting practices of international peer s and is presented within the context of 
international best practice, as well as contributing to work underway to strengthen 
transparency in future budgets.  
Physical Impacts of Climate Change  
Global warming continues to c hange Australia ’s weather and climate, and over the course 
of this century this will drive changes in Australia ’s economy – with respect to both its size 
and structure. This includes impacts on human health, biodiversity, the location and 
movement of popul ations, the types of structures we live in, and the way we work.   
Rising temperatures will also present new economic challenges, impacting labour 
productivity, capital investment, and demand for our exports. As shown in the 2023 
Intergenerational Report (I GR),  rising temperatures are expected to result in reductions in 
labour productivity and hours worked, particularly for employees who work outdoors   |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 108  |  Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  
such as in agriculture, construction and manufacturing. Agricultural yields are expected to 
decline with cli mate change. The increased frequency and severity of natural disasters will 
also lead to reductions in output through disruptions to economic activity and destruction 
of property and infrastructure.  
Effective adaptation and investment in resilience can re duce the impacts of some climate 
change -related disruptions. However, the extent of economic disruption will increase 
significantly with greater temperature increases. This means mitigating further climate 
change through effective global action by way of d ecarbonisation has significant economic 
value to Australia.   
Net zero spending   
The Government is committed to improving the transparency of public money committed 
to climate action. It recognises the importance of identifying, disclosing, and tracking net 
zero spending in improving Australia ’s response to climate change and aligning with 
international efforts. Accounting for net zero spending comprehensively is challenging as it 
cuts across many portfolios, ranging from energy to health. Existing budget systems also do 
not readily facilitate reporting net zero spending on established programs. For this reason, 
reporting of net zero spending focuses on new  measures . 
Australia ’s classification approach  
The October 2022 –23 and 2023 –24 Budgets report climate -related measures up until 
June  2030. This Budget builds on this approach by extending the reporting period to over 
the forward estimates period  and medium term,  and additionally repo rting investments in 
Strengthening net zero industries and skills  (Box 3. 5).  
The Government ’s action on climate change is not limited to the four categories used in the 
previous two budgets, but also includes measures that enable net zero industries of the 
future. The new category of Strengthening net zero industries and skills  highlights plans to 
transform Australia into a renewable energy superpower and other measures associated 
with the transformation of the  economy to net zero by 2050.  
These changes reflect the government ’s focus on developing a Net Zero Plan which 
considers the role all sectors will play in reducing emissions and transforming Australia ’s 
economy.  
This reporting framework maintains alignmen t with international best practice and recent 
budgets. It will continue to evolve over time as the Government works with and learns 
from reporting entities and partners around the world. Australian Government Green 
Bonds will contribute to financing measur es within the first and third categories of Box  3.5. 
The reporting of climate -related categories in the budget process  is complementary to the  
Australian  Government  Green Bond Framework , and to allocation and impacts repor ting 
under this Framework , which aligns with international best practice in green bond 
financing .  
Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook   |  Page 109 
Box 3. 5: Defining and categorising net zero spending  
The Government is currently investing in the net zero transformation in five ways:  
• Reducing emissions in Australia ’s energy system and broader economy.  
• Strengthening net zero industries and skills . 
• Adapting to climate change  and improving climate and disaster resilience  
(spending to support Australia manage the physical impacts of climate change ). 
• International climate leadership (spending to support how we engage through 
international fora and with other jurisdictions ). 
• Building Australian Government climate capability  (spending on the capabilities 
of Government to ensure it effectively delivers on its objectives and to enable a 
national approach on climate change ). 
These categories provide a simple to understand framework for why each measure 
has been classified as contributing to net zero action. These categories are expected 
to evolve over time as Australia ’s approach to net zero budget transparency 
matures.  Policies may contribute to multiple net zero or non -net zero objectives; 
spending is clas sified into the most appropriate category based on its primary 
purpose. Some policies may contribute indirectly to net zero objectives; these have 
not been included in the current approach.  
In addition to direct funding towards programs, net zero spending  may also include 
balance sheet and tax expenditure items. For example, a tax concession  does not 
require an appropriation of funds, but reflect s foregone revenue, and is classified as 
spending for this purpose.  
Indirect benefit example  
Health system fundin g supports responses to the health effects of climate change, 
such as more extreme heat days. It also supports services for existing health 
conditions. There are different ways the spending could be classified, the whole 
amount, none, or a proportion could  be classified as net zero spending.  
In this Budget, spending with only an indirect contribution to net zero action is 
excluded. If there is a specific program in health related to climate impacts, that 
would be counted (for example the  2022 –23 October  Budget measure: National 
Health and Climate Strategy) .

The role of net zero enabling industries in emissions reduction  
Delivering net zero requires significant action to produce renewable energy and sustainable 
fuels, and reduce emissions from heavy industry, buildings  and agriculture . Australia ’s 
abundant renewable energy resources will also support the once -in-a-generation 
opportunity to reposition the economy for future prosperity by supporting global 
decarbonisation. Achieving these changes at pace requires investing in secure and resilient 
net zero supply chains and a skilled workforce.  
The Government is inves ting in these industries to prepare the economy for a net zero 
transformation.  Targeted investments to ensure  a resilient  clean energy manufacturing  
supply chain  and expanding the supply of scarce inputs , such as critical minerals , are 
essential to enable the net zero transformation.  Moreover,  invest ment s to prepare the 
workforce for clean industries  will also give Australia an enduring comparative advantage 
domestically and globally .  
The Government ’s focus on these industries reflects the fact that Austra lia’s exports will be 
increasingly comprised of low  carbon products. Over 97  per cent of Australia ’s trading 
partners have set net zero targets.  Australia is expected to be competitive in products that 
have renewable energy as an input, reflecting the low cost and growing abundance of our 
renewable electricity supply. This means Australia ’s net zero industrial transformation can 
also support major  trading partners to reduce their emissions, making Australia an 
indispensable part of global net zero supply chains .   
Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook   |  Page 111 
For instance, exports of  critical minerals , renewable hydrogen  and green metals could 
reduce global emissions significantly.  In this way,  pursuing Australia ’s industrial net zero 
opportunities could position Australia to make an outsized contribution to global climate 
mitigation and build resilience to changes in trade patterns due to a shift away from 
emissions -intensive resources.  
The 20 23–24 Budget identified $40  billion of industrial and energy commitments related to 
the Government ’s renewable energy superpower ambitions. In addition to that spending, a 
further $ 3.0 billion was announced in the 2023 –24 MYEFO. This Budget contains $ 3.6 over 
the forward estimates period and $ 22.5 billion over the medium term in new spending on 
these new industries.  
The emissions -reduction measures that are part of the Governments overall investment to 
establish Australia as a renewable energy superpower contribute to a broader set of 
climate -related spending, which includes measures that are related to adaptation, 
international engagement and public sector climate capability. Box  3.6 below explains the 
complementary scope of renewable energy  and other net zero spending.     |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 112  |  Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  
Box 3.6 Investing in our plan to become a Renewable Energy Superpower   
Australia ’s ambition  to becom e a Renewable Energy Superpower will require 
investment into  low emission  industries and their underlying enablers  that play an 
indirect yet important role  in the net zero transformation . In particular:  
• Critical minerals are essential for many low  emissions technologies, including 
electric vehicles, solar panels, wind turbines and batteries. Investment will allow 
a sovereign supply chain resilient to external shocks.   
• Low  emissions fuels will be key to propelling clean industry and decarbonising 
hard to abate sectors and the broader economy.  
• Decarbonising Australia ’s exports will assist global efforts to  reduce emissions . 
Spending towards measures that are directly related to climate change overlaps with 
the Government ’s investments to become a rene wable energy superpower. 
However, these figures relate to a different yet complementary scope of activities, as 
highlighted in the figure below.  
Of the  five categories in Australia ’s climate reporting framework, items in the 
emissions reduction and enabli ng net zero industries categories  contribute to the 
estimate of Australia ’s investment in becoming a renewable energy superpower.

New net zero spending measures  
Table 3.7 sets out $ 5.0 billion in net zero spending commitments over the forward estimates 
period and $ 24.3 billion over the medium term . This is in addition to climate -related 
spending of $4.6  billion (to 2030) committed in the 2023 –24 Budget and the $24.9  billion 
(to 2030) committed in the 2022 –23 October Budget.  
Classification of spending is informed by the net zero  spending  framework defined in 
Table  3.6 above. The total commitment includes spending, balance sheet and tax 
expenditure measures and therefore presents a broader view than the impact on the 
underlying cash balance.  
Reporting new net zero spending measures supports transparency around the fiscal 
impacts of climate change and the n et zero transformation. However, it does not provide 
a complete summary of climate action. Only measures that entail funding commitments or 
foregone revenue (such as tax concessions) are captured. Therefore, measures without 
spending, such as regulatory re forms to the Safeguard Mechanism, are not captured. 
Measures that may contribute to climate action but have a different primary purpose are 
not included.  
Australia ’s approach to reporting net zero spending commitments is a separate and 
independent framewo rk to the established functional expense tables in Budget Statement  6: 
Expenses  and Net Capital Investment , which aligns with international standards. These cannot 
be combined for analysis of government spending.   
This summary focuses specifically on new net zero  spending  commitments in this Budget. 
The Government is developing an approach to presenting transparent spending 
information on existing spending commitments. Over time, this  will provide a more 
holistic view of the total amount of Government spend ing, not just what is new in each 
budget .

Appendix A: Other fiscal aggregates  
Accrual aggregates  
Accrual accounting records income and costs at the time they are incurred. Cash 
accounting records income and costs at time of associa ted actual cash flow. Differences in 
estimates arise where there is a difference between the timing of an activity and the 
associated cash flow.  
Net operating balance estimates  
The net operating balance is an accrual measure, reflecting revenue minus expe nses. 
It excludes the fiscal impact of the Australian  Government ’s net new capital expenditure.  
The net operating balance is expected to be a surplus of $15.8 billion (0. 6 per cent of GDP)  
in 2023 –24 (Table  3.8). It is then expected to be a deficit of $ 23.0 billion ( 0.8 per cent of GDP) 
in 2024 –25, compared to an expected deficit of $ 15.7 billion in MYEFO .  
Fiscal balance  
The fiscal balance is the accrual equivalent of the underlying cash balance and equals the 
net operating balance plus net new capital investment.  
The fiscal balance is expected to be a surplus of $ 8.1 billion ( 0.3 per cent of GDP) in 202 3–24 
(Table  3.8). It is then  expected to be a deficit of $ 29.3 billion ( 1.1 per cent of GDP) in 2024 –25, 
compared to an expected deficit of $ 24.8 billion in MYEFO .

Revenue estimates  
Revenue is the accrual accounting equivalent of cash -based  receipts. Changes in revenue 
are generally driven by the same factors as receipts. Revenue amounts can be higher or 
lower than the cash equivalents as they include amounts that a taxpayer is liable  to pay but 
has not paid. The differences between the accrual and cash amounts generally reflect 
timing differences.  
Total revenue since MYEFO has been revised up by $ 11.2 billion in 202 4–25 and by  
$30.0 billion  over four years from 2023 –24 to 2026 –27.  
Expense estimates  
Expenses are the accrual accounting equivalent of cash -based payments.  
Total expenses since MYEFO have been revised up by $1 8.5 billion in 2024 –25 and by 
$45.9 billio n over four  years from 2023 –24 to 2026 –27.  
Movements in expenses over the forward estimates period are broadly consistent with 
movements in cash payments. The key exceptions include:  
• the NDIS program, where there is an expected time lag between the receipt of 
reasonable and necessary support services and the lodgement of claims relating to 
those  services  
• superannuation benefits programs (civilian and military), where there is a timing 
difference with the expense accruing during employment and cash p ayments occurring 
during retirement  
• purchases of nonfinancial  assets, which are included in cash payments but not in 
accrual expenses. The expense estimates include depreciation of non -financial assets 
rather than recognising the impact at the time of pur chase.  
Detailed information on expenses can be found in Statement 6:  Expenses and Net Capital 
Investment.   
Structural budget balance estimates  
The structural budget balance estimate adjusts the underlying cash balance to  remove the 
estimated effects of cyclical factors that have a temporary impact on receipts and payments. 
These  factors include deviations in commodity prices and economic activity from their 
long -run levels. The structural budget balance can provide insigh t into the sustainability of 
fiscal settings.  
The structural balance is estimated rather than observed, so it is sensitive to the 
assumptions and parameters that underpin it. Commodity price volatility has increased the 
uncertainty around the estimate.   
Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook   |  Page 119 
The estimated structural budget balance has been revised up in 2023 –24 but is lower in 
most years over the forward estimates period compared to MYEFO (Chart 3.1 4). These 
changes largely reflect revisions to the underlying cash balance.  
The contribution of c yclical factors to the underlying cash balance is estimated to remain 
positive in 2023 –24 and 2024 –25. The smaller contribution in 2023 –24 compared to MYEFO 
in large part reflects revisions to the terms of trade (see Budget Statement 2: Economic Outlook  
for more information on developments in commodity prices and the terms of trade).  
Over the medium term, t he structural budget balance is projected to improve gradually 
towards  balance.

Note:  The approach separating the budgetary impact of cyclical factors  from structural measures follows 
the methodology detailed in Treasury Working Paper 2013 –01. Cyclical factors measure the 
estimated impact on the underlying cash bal ance from automatic stabilisers and cyclical 
movements in asset and commodity prices. Temporary fiscal measures comprise direct economic 
and health support measures initiated between the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic and the 
2022 –23 October  Budget. Unders pends in these direct economic and health support measures  are 
not captured in the derivation of the structural budget balance, which may result in an improved 
structural budget balance estimate.  
 
 Statement 4: Meeting Australia's Housing Challenge   |  Page 121 Statement 4:  
Meeting Australia ’s Housing  Challenge  
Australia has a housing shortage . There are not enough homes being built in the right areas 
to meet the needs of our communities . This statement focuses on the reasons for the current 
undersupply of housing, how it affects affordability, and the changes required to more 
quickly unlock supp ly to meet the housing needs of all Australians. It also sets out how the 
Government ’s policy respond s to these drivers of undersupply . 
The Government is responding to build more homes for Australia. It has a $32 billion plan, 
including $6.2 billion of new  initiatives in this Budget. It represents a long -term response to 
a complex structural challenge.  
Australia ’s housing supply is low by international standards. Australia has among the 
lowest number of homes as a proportion of the population in the OECD . Undersupp ly is a 
key factor that has driven increases in rents, mortgage repayments and house prices.  
Australia ’s housing system has been too slow to respond to demand. The causes of this are 
multifaceted , complex  and affect  all stages of the housing construction process, including  
all levels of government a nd industry.  Planning and zoning and land release practices are 
often slow  and are not effectively  factoring in urgent need for housing in suburban areas. 
Industry ’s capac ity to add new supply has been  hampered by a  lack of essential 
infrastructure in greenfield  developments, a critical shortage of skilled labour  and falling 
productivity in the sector . At the same time , there has been a long -term, chronic  
under -investment  in social housing.  
Higher interest rates have added to Australians ’ cost of living, particularly  through higher 
mortgage repayments. Supply chain bottlenecks flowing from the COVID -19 pandemic and 
higher costs of construction and finance have co ntributed to making new housing supply 
more expensive, limiting how quickly homes can be built.  
Fixing supply and improving affordability will require concerted, cooperative and 
substantive efforts from all levels of government. The Government has a plan to increase 
supply, fund more social homes, better support renters , provide a pathway to home 
ownership  and double its dedicated funding for homelessness  services .  
In recognition of the national leadership needed to address Australia ’s housing supply 
challenges, the Government agree d with states, local government, industry and investors to 
deliver 1 .2 million  new, well -located homes in the five years to 30  June  2029  through the 
National Housing Accord  (the Accord) . This is being  supported by $3  billion  in incentive 
payments to the states , and other investments . This substantial commitment would be the 
equivalent of adding a city around the size of Brisbane to Australia ’s housing supply.  
The National Housing Supply and Affordability Council has found the ta rget is suitably 
ambitious to help galvanise stakeholders into action. But it can be achieved with  early, and 
sustained, policy effort from all levels of government. It requires a significant uplift in the  
 
 
Page 122  |  Statement 4: Meeting Austra lia's Housing Challenge  number of homes built in every state and territory. Governments will need to work quickly 
to identify and clear roadblocks to new supply and ensure h omebuyers  and renters  are able 
to buy or rent  new housing where they want to live.  
Addressing undersupply  requires more than continued expansion of housing in outer 
suburbs . State, territory and local governments will need to focus on rebuilding the 
‘miss ing middle ’ in Australia ’s cities – delivering more medium and high -density housing 
where infrastructure, transport, jobs, education and community amenities already exist. 
Regional areas need new approaches to supplying housing. This is needed to break the  
cycle of housing shortages making it difficult to attract the skills and labour – including 
construction labour – to support and sustain vital towns and regions.  
As part of the Government ’s commitment to this target, $1.5  billion  will be made available 
to the states and territories , including $1  billion  through the Budget , to help clear 
infrastructure bottlenecks delaying the construction of new housing. This support, coupled 
with the work underway through National Cabinet ’s Planning Reform Blueprint, pro vides 
the mechanism for states and territories to address structural inefficiencies in the planning, 
zoning and land release systems that prevent the market from responding more efficiently 
to demand. The Government is also investing $ 88.8 million  in the B udget to train more 
construction workers to help build more homes more quickly .  
The Government is supplementing this long -term structural reform with increased support 
for those who need it most. Low vacancy rates and falling numbers of rental properties  
have placed pressure on rental prices  over time; while  lower income earners have less 
capacity to absorb higher prices. Tha t is why the Government is increasing Commonwealth 
Rent Assistance (CRA) as part of this Budget, in addition to the increase in last year ’s 
Budget . Because of these increases and indexation, maximum rates of CRA will be 40 per 
cent higher than they were in  May 2022 which will benefit up to 1 million households.  
The Government has committed to an unprecedented program to support an increase in 
the supply of social and affordable housing  by around 55,000 homes  through the Accord , 
the Housing Australia Future Fund , the Social Housing Accelerator Payment  and other 
Housing Australia programs . New investment in this Budget includes $423.1 million in 
additional funding offered for the new $9.3 billion  five-year funding agreement to deliver 
social housing and homele ssness services.  The Government has already  helped more than 
110,000 low - to middle -income Australians overcome the deposit hurdle to get into home 
ownership  and will help more  through the expansion of  the Home Guarantee Scheme  and 
the new Help to Buy  program .  
Collectively,  the Government ’s plan to meet Australia ’s housing challenge goes to the heart 
of problems with structural undersupply, underinvestment in social and affordable 
housing, fairness for renters and barriers to home ownership.

Statement 4: Meeting Australia ’s Housing  
Challenge  
Australia has underinvested in housing for too long  
Box 4.1. Government ’s plan to correct Australia ’s housing 
underinvestment  
The Government has committed to $32 billion in new commitments  including $6.2 
billion in this Budget , to address historic underinv estment in the Australian housing 
system . 
 Actions under the Government ’s plan include:  
• A target for 1.2 million new, well -located homes backed by funding for the states 
to clear the bottlenecks and red tape preventing new homes from being built.  
• Funding 40,000 new social and affordable homes.  
• Increasing support to renters by 40 per cent.  
• Helping more Australians into home ownership.  
• Requiring universities to build more student accommodation .  
Australia has a housing shortage – we have too few hom es for those who 
need them  
Australia ’s housing system has been unable to build enough new housing stock to keep up 
with  the needs of our population . This has caused a  growing supply deficit , resulting in 
worsening affordability for both renters and first-home buyers. Concerted action and 
national leadership are needed  to increase investment in housing and improve supply . 
Additional supply is necessary to accommodate our population . However, lags between 
increased demand for housing and additional supply of  dwellings can create acute 
pressures for households. This can include a tighter rental market and upward pressure on 
rents.  
Between 1993 and 2011, steady rates of  housing construction were able to meet the needs of 
a growing population which increased by  27 per cent over the same period . From 2014 to 
2018  strong growth in  medium -high density dwellings contribut ed significantly to supply , 
with low interest rates encouraging a significant pick up in invest or activity  (Chart  4.1). 
Supporting the housing market to respond more flexibly to changes  in demand – including 
well -located medium -high density housing  – will help  address Australia ’s housing supply 
shortage and meet the needs of current and future generations.

Australia ’s level of housing supply  is low by international  standards  
Chart 4.2 shows  Australia ’s housing  supply relative to other  OECD countries . While 
differences across OECD countries reflect a range of factors including differences in age 
structure, population growth, cultural norms, and the size and quality of the housing stock,  
Australia has fewer dwellings per 1,000 people tha n the OECD average.  
According to the OECD, Australia ’s level of housing supply was at 403 per 1 ,000 people 
in 2011 . This increas ed to 420 per 1 ,000 people in 2022 . However, this  incre ase in supply 
was insufficient to  keep pace with international peers,  falling from around 92  per cent of 
the OECD average in 2011  to 90 per cent of the OECD average by 2022.  
Australia lags  behind other countries like Canada, the US and the UK (England) in terms  of 
dwellings per 1,000 people .

A lack of supply is making it harder for people  to buy or rent  
A shortage  of housing stock is making it difficult to find a property to b uy or rent.  The 
number of homes being offered for sale has fallen since 2015 (Chart  4.3), while the number 
of homes for rent has been falling since early 2020  (Chart 4.4).

Box 4. 2. Government actions to increase market housing supply  
More homes need to be built in the places that households need them, including 
close to places of work and education for families, workers and students This 
requires careful planning and better collaboration with non -government partners to 
meet  the changing needs of our communities.  
Australia’s growing international education sector requires adequate supply of 
purpose -built student a ccommodation to ensure its ongoing sustainability . To 
deliver more accommodation for student s and to reduce pressure on the private 
rental market, the Government will work with the higher education sector to 
develop regulations that will require universiti es to increase their supply of student 
accommodation . 
 The Government is also developing the National Housing and Homelessness Plan 
(the Plan).  The Plan will be a 10 -year strategy and outline how all levels of 
government can work together with the private and the community sector to deliver 
the short -, medium - and long -term actions needed.  
The Plan will build on the Accord, where the Government is working with states 
and territories, local governments, industry and investors to deliver 1.2  million  new, 
well -located dwellings in the five years from 1  July 2024.  
New homes are needed in every state and territory – not just in the major population 
centres that attract most of the population growth.  That is why the Government is 
offering $3 billon in i ncentive payments through the New Homes Bonus to be shared 
amongst all states and territories to reach their share of the 1.2  million  target.  
The Government will provide state, territory and local governments with payments 
to fund the enabling infrastructu re (water and sewage connections, roads and 
footpaths) needed to develop new homes  through the $1.5  billion  Housing Support 
Program .

Investment by g overnment s in social housing has declin ed over decades   
In addition to low levels of aggregate housing s tock, rates of construction of social housing 
(which includes both public housing and community housing)  have also fallen steadily . 
Public housing  is defined by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare  (AIHW)  as 
rental housing that state and territory governments provide and manage , and is a subset of 
social housing . Social housing  is rental housing fully  or partly funded by government , 
owned or managed by community organisations or governments , and  includes public 
housing, state owned  and man aged Indigenous housing , community housing and 
Indigenous community housing.3 Public housing completions  (Chart 4.6) and the share of 
social housing stock as a proportion of the total stock has declined  for the last three decades  
(Chart 4.7). Research notes  that since 1996, the level of social housing construction has not 
been enough to keep pace with sales and demolitions  of existing social housing stock .4  
Since 1958 , the Australian Government  has pro vided  rent assistance  which helps people on 
income support payments with the cost of  rental housing . As a n income supplement, 
Commonwealth Rent Assistance is able to respond to recipients ’ needs in a timel y way, can 
adapt  as their  needs change over time , supports housing choice , and can  help  meet the cost 
of increase s in rent.5 The National Housing Supply and Affordability Council suggests that 
renter households  receiving C ommonwealth Rent Assistance  have seen improved 
affordabili ty in recent years .6 In March  2024, Commonwealth Rent Assistance  helped 
reduce  the percentage of recipient households experiencing rental stress by around  
31 percentage points .7

Box 4. 3 Government actions to increase social and affordable housing  
The Government is tackling housing stress for lower income households, with 
investments expected to support around 55,000 new social and affordable homes,  
increasing the stock of social and affo rdable housing by over 12  per cent. This will be 
achieved through:  
• The $10  billion  Housing Australia Future Fund (HAFF), which seeks to deliver 
30,000 new social and affordable homes over its first five years, including homes 
for women and children impacte d by family and domestic violence.  
• The National Housing Accord, under which the Australian  Government  will 
deliver 10,000 affordable homes, to be matched by states and territories.  
• Additional concessional financing for community housing providers and othe r 
charities to support the HAFF and Accord of $1.9  billion.  
• The $2  billion  Social Housing Accelerator Payment , which will fund 4,000 new 
and refurbished social homes.  
• Expanding the Affordable Housing Bond Aggregator by increasing Housing 
Australia ’s liabi lity cap to $10  billion  from $5.5  billion . 
• Providing an additional $1  billion  to the National Housing Infrastructure Facility, 
targeted toward crisis and transitional accommodation for women and children 
fleeing domestic violence, and youth.

Affordability pressures  are high  
Supply shortages contribute to  affordability pressures  
The lag in  housing supply responding to changes in  population has contributed to rising 
house prices and worsening affordability. Charts 4.9 and 4.10 show that nominal dwelling 
prices and advertised rents have more than doubled since the mid -2000s .

As a result of price pressures, an  increasing share of household incomes is going towards 
housing and housing services , particularly for lower -income rental households , with 
marked growth since 2020  (Chart 4.1 1). For prospective homebuyers, the portion of income 
needed to service a new loan has risen from an average of 29  per cent in 2020 to 46  per cent 
in 2023 . This  is above the long -run average of 3 5.7 per cent and above the 30  per cent

Long term decline in affordability  
In the March  quarter of 2002, the median house price was 4.9 times the median gross 
disposal household  income. By the  March  quarter of 2024, this had increased to 8.6 times 
median gross annual income (Chart 4.13). The unit price -to-income ratio has not grown as 
fast – reflecting recent growth in the supply of medium -high density housing  and rising 
land  values, as medium -high density developments contain  more dwellings per square 
metre of land.8 While there has been short term volatility,  Australians are also taking longer 
to save for a deposit, with the time taken to save a 20 per cent house deposit reaching 
almost 11.4 years in the  March  quarter 202 4, down from a historic peak of 12.1 years in 
the March quarter 2022  (Chart 4.1 4). These factors have contributed to declining rates of 
home ownership over time, and more people are now renting (Chart 4.1 5).

Box 4. 4 Government actions to help renters and support more people into 
home ownership  
As prices have risen, more Australians are finding it difficult to pay their rent . This is 
why the Government is stepping in to ease the burden  while the housing system is 
improved to bring on more supply over time.  
As part of the Government ’s broader responsible and affordable cost -of-living relief 
package, C ommonwealth Rent Assistance  (CRA) will be increased  by a f urther 
10 per cent. Alongside  the 15 per cent increase  provided  in September  2023  and 
regular indexation, this will take maximum rates over 40  per cent higher than 
in May  2022 . Outside of regular indexation, the 2023 –24 Budget and 2024 –25 Budget 
CRA  increases are the first back -to-back increases to maximum rates of CRA  in three 
decades.  This will help to address pressure in the rental market caused by low 
vacancy rates and falling supply.  
In recognitio n of the more challenging  situation rent ers are f acing, the Government 
is also working with states and territories to strengthen renters ’ rights through A 
Better Deal for Renters. As part of this package, all levels of government have agreed 
to implement a 9 -point plan that includes:  
• Developing a nationa lly consistent policy to implement a requirement for 
genuine reasonable grounds for eviction.  
• Moving towards limiting rent increases to once a year.  
• Phasing in minimum rental standards.  
In addition, t he Government is introducing concessional tax treatment to encourage 
the development of more build -to-rent accommodation to increase the supply of 
rental properties and increase their affordability.  The Government has also lowered 
foreign investment application fees for new build -to-rent developments to further  
encourage an increase in the supply of rental properties.   
The Government is also helping more renters to transition to home ownership 
through introducing legislation to establish the Help to Buy scheme. The Help to 
Buy scheme will support up to 40,000 el igible households to purchase a home by 
providing them an equity contribution of up to 40  per cent of the purchase price for 
new homes and 30  per cent for existing homes. Together with the expanded  Home 
Guarantee Scheme, this will help more Australian hous eholds achieve  home 
ownership.

Statement 4: Meeting Australia's Housing Challenge   |  Page 139 
Affordability challenges have productivity , health and social inclusion 
implications  
A well -functioning housing system allows workers to be  close to their employment, 
reduces commute times and travel costs, and encourages labour force participation, social 
mobility and cohesion.  
A collective lack of investment in housing – both public and private – can result in a 
housing system that entrench es adverse health and socio -economic outcomes. Unstable 
housing prevents workers from finding meaningful employment and creates more 
disruptions for children ’s education.  This is e specially pronounced for children  vulnerable 
to socioeconomic inequality,  living in disadvantaged neighbourhoods  or being unable to 
rely on intergenerational wealth transfers . Quality housing improves children’s 
development and wellbeing, and can lead to better education outcomes , particularly for 
those with intergenerational disa dvant age.9  
An undersupplied and underinvested housing system creates more instances of 
overcrowded and poor -quality dwellings, which Brackertz et al . (2019) identifies as 
increasing the likelihood of developing chronic physical and mental  health conditions , and 
increasing the risk of domestic and family violence.10 In 2022–23 around 38 per cent of all 
specialist homelessness services clients ha d experi enced family and domestic violence .11 
Increased housing supply and affordability in well -located areas can positively affect 
wages and productivity by reducing barriers to job switching. Job switching rates in 
Australia are low and have declined over the p ast 30 years.12 Research suggests job 
switchers are likely to move to more productive firms, with the average productivity gap 
between origin and destination firms at 13.1  per cent. It can also enable workers to move to 
a role which better matches their in dividual skillset.13 These factors can influence aggregate 
productivity as they allow firms with higher average productivity to increase output. 
Workers are also more likely to realise wage gains when switching into a new role, which 
can improve their  standard of living.14

As Australia has shifted towards a service -based economy , many  firms have set up offices 
in central business district s. National Housing Supply and Affordability Council research 
shows  workers are living an increasi ngly further distance from their place of work , 
associating this with a lack of affordable housing in cities.15 An increase in well -located  
housing in urban areas with access to public transport and amenities will make it easier for 
workers to switch jobs to more productive firms  and seek higher wages , and will improve 
the productive capacity of the Australian economy.  A lack of affordable ho using in regional 
areas  can also undermine the ability of businesses to attract workers and represents lost 
economic potential for regions.  
Barriers to the construction of new homes need to be 
addressed   
Action is needed to improve housing system  responsiveness  
Australia ’s housing system has been  unable to sufficiently respond to demand . Housing 
requires longer lead times to respond to price signals  than many other goods and services . 
On average, in 2022–23 a house in Australia took around  nine  months  to build, while a 
block of apartments took over 24 months  to complete.16 Structural factors influence the 
speed at which new housing can be supplied , with  planning and approval s to release land 
necessary for construction to take place.  These are often delayed , and timing can  vary 
significantly between state and territory jurisdictions.  In addition , planning and zoning 
processes,  the capacity and productivity of the construction sector  and expensive  materials  
costs can further slow  the pace of housing  construction.

This relationship between supply and prices means that accelerating new supply will help 
to lower prices and ease affordability pressures. This is supported by empirical research 
which shows that:17 
•  OECD countries that built more housing between 1990 to 2015 experienced lower 
growth in real house prices;18  
• Adding an extra 50,000 homes a year for a decade could reduce house prices up to 
20 per cent;19 
• A 1 per cent increase in the stock of dwellings could lower house prices by 2.5  per cent.20 
Rates of construction need to be accelerated   
Rates of construction are reducing the capacity of the market to respond to increased 
demand. Apartment, townhouse and detached ho use completion times increased 
nationally  by 39 per cent, 34 per cent and 42  per cent respectively over the 10-year period to 
2022–23.21 Most of this increase is concentrated over the pandemic period, however there 
has been a relatively consistent upward trend in apartment construction times since 2018 –
19.  
Modelling from the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council shows Australi a’s 
existing unmet  demand for housing will not be satisfied  unless the responsiveness of 
supply to demand  is improved.  Over the Council ’s 6-year projection horizon, new market 
demand is expected to exceed new market supply by around 39,000 dwellings.22 While new 
supply and new demand will roughly be in balance from the 2026 –27 financial year 
onwards , this suggests that without concerted action to reduce barriers to new supply, 
Australia ’s excess demand for housing will continue to go unmet.

Faster planning and zoning approval processes can help unlock supply  
Planning and zoning restrictions can limit the speed at which land is made available for 
development. Development application processes  grant  approval s for land to be released 
for develop ment , often at the local government level. Delays  in assessment timelines can 
increase cost and uncertainty for developers.23 For example, longer approval  timeframes 
may be  indicative of aversion to new development in a particular area , particularly for 
larger developments .24 Average observed approval times for development application 
decisions vary by state, with Victoria and New South Wales experiencing the longest 
average  approval wait times a t 143.6 and 114 days respectively  as at 8  May  2024 .25 Lengthy 
approval timeframes  can increase effective development times for new dwellings and  limit 
the responsiveness of housing supply to demand.  
Planning and zoning processes shoul d focus on ensuring housing is 
delivered where  it is needed  
Planning and zoning restrictions divert additional housing away from well -located areas 
where demand is greatest. Medium - to high -density housing in urbanised areas is 
necessary to ensure  Australia ’s housing supply efficiently responds to demand. It offers a 
more efficient use of construction sector resources, can better cater to household location 
and amenity preferences and reduce demand pressures in inner -city locations.  
Dense development in the ‘missing middle ’ of major Australian cities, where households 
can reside closer to jobs in areas with higher quality amenities and infrastructure, has been 
limited by planning and zoning r estrictions  and slow release of infill land.26 Using 2016 
data, the gap between the cost of supplying a new apartment and its market value in 
Sydney was  $355,000 (68  per cent of costs), $97,000 in Melbourne (20  per cent of costs) and 
$10,000 in Brisbane (2  per cent of costs).27 These gaps are sustained by planning and zoning 
restrictions, which force additional development outwards rather than where demand is 
greatest. As a result, recent development has been concentrated in city fringes where 
detached dwel lings are more likely to be constructed, particularly in Melbourne and 
Brisbane. All jurisdictions except the A ustralian Capital Territory  have approve d more

result .28 
Barriers to building homes in well -located areas not only reduce supply in areas of high 
demand and increase commute times but make new and existing homes less affordable. 
Building new homes in greenfield areas requires new infrastructure, which can add t o the 
time and cost of development . For example,  infrastructure  costs in some  outer -urban parts 
of Sydney are up to $75,000 higher per dwelling than for inner -city areas .29 
Rezoning urban areas to allow greater density can increase the supply of housing. 
In 2016,  Auckland Council upzoned around three quarters of its residential land to permit 
higher maximum site coverage and height. This led to a significant increase in housing 
permits and construction in the upzoned areas, particularly in locations close t o transport 
and employment opportunities, which contributed to Auckland rents for three  bedroom 
dwellings being 22 to 35  per cent lower than they otherwise would have been six years on 
from the introduction of the policy.30 
It is also important that new medium -high density builds are constructed to a high quality, 
to maintain consumer confidence and ensure demand for higher density housing.

Box 4. 5 Government actions to reform the planning system  
Planning and zoning decisions have a significant impact on the rate of land release 
and where and how quickly  new housing supply can be built .  
To help the planning system more effec tively facilitate the number of new homes 
needed, National Cabinet has agree d the National Planning Reform Blueprint. The 
Blueprint brings state and territory planning ministers together to progress 17 
reforms to deliver more homes, including:  
•  Streamlinin g development approvals.  
• Identifying well -located development ready land.  
• Increasing housing density in target areas .  
• Identifying how housing can be built faster on sites with development approval 
but where development has not commenced ( i.e. activating ‘zombie’ approvals) . 
• Ensuring that state, regional and local strategic plans reflect their share of the 
national 1.2  million  new homes target.  
Action to make  construction cheaper  will also help more homes be 
built  faster  
Global price shocks and supply constraints associated with COVID -19 have added to the 
costs of construction . Materials input costs , as captured in  Producer Price Index , increased 
significantly  over the pandemic, including for  timber, con crete , and metal  products . 
Alongside elevated labour costs, t hese drove a sharp increase in the price of building  a new 
dwelling , as measured in the Consumer Price Index , which contributed to the sharp rise in 
inflation  (Chart  4.16). Although growth in construction costs for new dwellings have eased , 
they continue to grow  from an already elevated level .  Budget Paper No. 1   |

Labour  shortages have also slowed the pace of constructio n. A shortage of skills and labour 
in the construction sector  has persisted since  the pandemic given high dem and and existing 
shortages . Industry estimates  suggest the construction sector is facing a shortfall of around 
90,000 workers.31 The most acute trade shortages i n the first quarter of 2024 existed in 
bricklaying, ceramic tiling, plastering, carpentry and roofing.32 Construction sector j ob 
vacancies have fallen considerably from the peak in 2022 but remain well above historical 
averages (Chart  4.17).  
These labour  shortages can partially be explained by an increase in non -dwelling 
construction  activity , that has drawn on the supply of labour available for dwelling 
construction. The rate of growth of investment in  public infra structur e and non-dwelling 
constru ction has increased significantly relative to  residential construction activity  
(Chart  4.18). At the same time as labour shortages have worsened , labour productivity in 
the construction industry  has not increased from the level it was in the early 2000s  (Chart 
4.19), while  other sectors have seen significant productivity growth .

Box 4. 6 Government actions to invest in more skilled construction workers  
Capacity constraint s in the construction sector are a key impediment to faster 
delivery of new homes. According to industry, there has been a significant shortage 
of construction workers in recent years, driven by a drop off in rates of skilled 
migration during  the COVID -19 pandemic and competition from infrastructure 
projects. This has slowed the ability of builders to build more homes quickly and 
driven up the price of labour.  
The Government is responding to this challenge by investing $88.8  million  to grow 
the pipeline of construction workers through 20,000 additional fee -free TAFE and 
pre-apprenticeship places. The Government will also provide $1.8  million  to deliver 
streamlined skills assessments for around 1,900  migrants from comparable counties 
to work in Australia ’s housing construction industry.  
The Hom eBuilder program  provided grants of up to $25 ,000 to eligible owner -occup iers to 
build or substantially renovate a home.  HomeBuilder was intended to support confidence 
in the residential construction sector and encourage  consumers to proceed with purchases Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 4: Meeting Australia's Housing Challenge   |  Page 147 
or renovations that may have been delayed due to uncertainty caused by the COVID -19 
pandemic.   
While HomeBuilder, alongside low interest rates, increased investment in the residential 
construction sector, it co ncentrated this demand in the detached sector (Chart 4. 20). The 
program brought forward investment demand ahead of what the detached sector was able 
to sustainabl y build  (Chart 4.2 1). The program added to inflation pressures in the sector by 
placing additi onal pressure on constrained supply chains . It also contributed to national 
land price growth of 14  per cent in 2021 and 22  per cent in 2022, alongside reduced 
greenfield lot releases.33 This demonstrates the potential risk to affordability presented by 
programs which stimulate  investment  demand for housing without addressing supply 
constraints.

Productivity Commission research has suggested that for government program s assisting 
households to purchase a home, the assistance is likely to be capitalised into house prices 
when not accompanied with an increase in supply. This tends to benefit sellers and existing 
owners, rather than buyers, which in turn further prices low - and middle -income 
households out of owning their own home.34 Any s upport for home ownership should  be 
specific and  targeted .

Box 4. 7 Targets to increase supply: an alternative to demand stimulation  
The initial target of 1 million  new, well -located homes set in the Accord in 
October  2022 aimed to deliver significant new housing supply above that needed to 
keep pace with demand. Based on  estimates at that time, it would have delivered 
sufficient new homes to achieve this.  
Higher interest rates  were expected to dampen demand and slow the rate of new 
household formation. This would have reduced the pressure on the construction 
sector, allo wing it to work through the large pipeline of work in progress that 
developed through the COVID -19 pandemic due to labour force shortages, supply 
chain challenges and demand stimulus.  
However, the housing market remained resilient despite the changes in i nterest 
rates, and demand remained high. In part, this was driven by  a recovery in  
population growth as Australia emerged  from the pandemic and international 
borders reopened  and Australians demanding more space for housing to 
accommodate new activities, s uch as working from home. This higher -than -expected 
demand, combined with cost pressures and delays in the construction sector, has 
contributed to worsening affordability for many Australians.  
As a result, the Australian Government agreed with state and t erritory governments 
to increase the target under the Accord to 1.2  million  new, well -located homes. This 
higher target will require additional policy reform to be met, but will ensure housing 
supply grows quickly enough to meet the needs of our population . Housing supply 
growth at this rate will enable more Australians to find the housing they want and 
will reduce pressure on prices.  
Changes to the supply side of the housing system required to meet this target will 
have long term benefits beyond the perio d of the Accord target. They will ensure 
Australia has a housing supply system responsive to demand as conditions change 
over time.

Statement 4: Meeting Australia's Housing Challenge   |  Page 149 
The Government ’s plan to meet Australia ’s housing challenge  
The challenges in Australia ’s housing system are caused by c omplex structural factors that 
have built up over time, and will take long term co -operative effort to address.  
That is why the Government is working with all levels of government, industry and 
investors to reform our housing system to make it fairer and more efficient; a system that 
delivers more homes and offers more assistance to those who need it. Australia needs a 
system more attuned to our future than our past.  
The Government ’s vision is ambitious and deliberately designed to provoke change in the 
housing system. While change will take time, the Government is laying the foundations 
and working across all parts of the system to improve affordability and fairness.  
It is in this context that the Government has a plan to meet Australia ’s housing challenge. It 
seeks to:  
• Kickstart construction of more homes by building infrastructure, training tradies, and 
cutting planning hurdles.  
• Deliver the biggest investment in social and affordable housing in over a decade.  
• Provide more support for renters – including the biggest increase to rent assistance in 
more than 30 years . 
• Help Australians buy their own home.  
• Double its dedicated  homelessness funding and provide shelter for people in crisis – 
including women and children fleeing domestic violence, veteran s, and youth.  
This plan is backed up by $32  billion  in new commitments . It is backed by an 
unprecedented level of cooperation with state, territories and local governments, industry 
and investors through the National Housing Accord. Actions include:  
• A targ et for 1.2  million  new, well -located homes . 
• Funding 40,000 new social and affordable homes . 
• The first back -to-back  increase  in the maximum rates o f Commonwealth Rent 
Assistance outside of indexation changes in three decades.  
• Helping more Australian s into h ome ownership.   
The development of the  10-year  National Housing and Homelessness Plan (the Plan)  is a 
critical component of the Government ’s housing strategy. It seeks to set a shared vision 
from all levels of government and work with the private and commu nity sector to address 
housing challenges , including the need to deliver more housing supply.   
 
  |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 150  |  Statement 4: Meeting Australia's Housing Challenge  
Kickstarting construction of more homes   
Correcting Australia ’s housing shortage requires governments to create a policy 
environment that better enables industry and investors to respond to demand. This means 
getting the planning system right, fixing labour and skills shortages and providing the 
infrastructure to enable more homes to come on -line faster and more economically. It 
means creating the governan ce arrangements for these cross -jurisdictional issues to be 
resolved effectively so communities can better hold their governments to account for the 
homes they  deliver.  
The National Housing Accord , which creates a framework for inter -government 
collaborati on, is central to the Government ’s plan to address the inter -jurisdictional factors 
affecting supply. It brings together state, territory and local governments, along with 
industry and investors to work cooperatively to increase the supply of new homes.  
The Accord seeks to deliver 1.2  million  new, well -located homes from 1  July 2024 to 
30 June  2029. It will focus on developing strategies for the planning system to support more 
homes, to make sure the right skills are available to build more homes and that investors 
supply more finance to fund more homes. The target is aimed to deliver significant new 
housing supply above that needed to keep pace with demand, to accommodate our 
population and support a slow but steady decline in average household size.  
Work under the National Housing Accord, including progress under its targets, is regularly 
monitored by Treasurers through the Council o n Federal Financial Relations.  
Delivering the enabling infrastructure to support new developments can be costly, and in 
some cases, uneconomical for private developers. That is why it can often act as a 
bottleneck preventing new supply from coming on the market. To overcome this barrier to 
new housing, the Housing Support Program  will offer state and local governments 
$500  milli on to develop the infrastructure required to enable new homes to be built (for 
example, connecting sewerage and water and roads). This will be boosted by an additional 
$1 billion  made available in this Budget to states and territories to deliver enabling 
infrastructure, taking the Government ’s total investment in the Housing Support Program 
to $1.5  billion .  
The Australian  Government  has committed $3  billion  in incentive payments to help deliver 
the 1.2  million  new homes target through the New Homes Bonus . This will give states and 
territories greater financial capacity to fund changes to planning and zoning systems as 
well as support the land release programs needed to reach the target.  
Improving the planning system so it facilitates more homes will also be  progressed through 
the National Planning Reform Blueprint (the Blueprint).  The Blueprint brings planning 
ministers together to progress 17 reforms to deliver more homes . These include:  
• Streamlining development approvals . 
• Identifying well -located development ready land . Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 4: Meeting Australia's Housing Challenge   |  Page 151 
• Increasing density in target areas . 
• Identifying how housing can be built faster on sites with development approval but 
where development has not commenced ( i.e. activating ‘zombie’ approvals) . 
• Ensuring that state, regional and local  strategic plans reflect their share of the national 
1.2 million  new homes target.  
Planning ministers will report on their progress in implementing the Blueprint twice a year  
to National Cabinet.  
The structural barriers to new homes will not be overcome unless the skills and labour 
shortages are addressed. That is why the Government is investing $8 8.8 million  to grow the 
pipeline of construction workers  through 20,000 additional fee -free TAFE and 
pre-apprenticeship places . This is in addition to the more than 355 ,000 fee-free TAFE places 
already delivered  in 2023 , of which 24,200 were in the construction sector . The Government 
will also provide $1.8  million  to deliver streamlined skills assessments for  around 1,900  
migrants from comparable countri es to work in Australia ’s housing construction industry.   
The Government will implement regulatory requirements to ensure  universities deliver 
more purpose -built student accommodation (PBSA) . This will increase the level of 
housing supply and help to ensure that increases in international student numbers do not 
put pressure on the domestic housing market. Following consultation with the sector, t he 
Government will set limits for how many inte rnational students can be enrolled by each 
university based on factors including how much student accommodation they provide . The 
Government  will require universities to establish new, purpose -built student 
accommodation should they wish to  increase their international student enrolments above 
their initial allocation.  Any new accommodation built will be available to both local and 
international students.  This reform will build more student housing, reduce pressure on  
house prices and rents in our cities an d ensure universities continue to be nefit  from the 
overseas student  market .  
Deliver the biggest investment in social and affordable housing in a 
decade  
The Government has been working to address the long -term decline in the delivery of 
social and afforda ble housing and to increase support for vulnerable Australians, including 
women and children leaving  family and domestic violence. This would increase the stock 
of social and affordable housing by over 1 2 per cent from 2022 levels . It is a significant 
investment and would mean that the Government would be adding one new social and 
affordable home for every eight currently available. This would also be the equivalent of 
adding a city the size of Darwin to Australia ’s housing stock.   
 
  |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 152  |  Statement 4: Meeting Australia's Housing Challenge  
The Government ’s investment will help to overcome the liquidity challenges some 
construction firms are facing because of the current cyclical downturn in residential 
building approvals. It will also help to reduce demand at the lower end of the private ren tal 
market, which will help to reduce the pressures that some other renters are feeling because 
of the current low rental vacancy rates.  
Central to the Government ’s plan to deliver more social and affordable housing is the 
$10 billion  Housing Australia Fu ture Fund (HAFF) , which seeks to deliver 30,000 new 
social and affordable homes over its first five years. Disbursements from the HAFF will 
also be used to deliver the Government ’s commitments to help address acute housing 
needs. This includes $200  million  for the repair, maintenance and improvement of housing 
in remote Indigenous communities, $100  million  for crisis and transitional housing options 
for women and children impacted by family and domestic violence and for older women at 
risk of homelessness , and $30  million  for veterans who are experiencing or are at risk of 
homelessness.  
This will be supported by the National Housing Accord . In addition to the actions being 
progressed to increase supply, the Government has agreed to deliver 10,000 affordable 
homes under the National Housing Accord, which will be matched by states and territories .  
This Budget provides additional  concessional financing of up  to $1.9  billion  for 
community housing providers and other charities  to support delivery of new social an d 
affordable dwellings  under  the HAFF and the National Housing Accord.  
The Government will supplement these initiatives by enhancing the programs 
administered by Housing Australia that provide concessional financing arrangements to 
facilitate the delivery of more social and affordable homes. This includes an additional 
$1 billion  for the National Housing Infrastructure Facility (NHIF),  which will be targeted 
towards crisis and transitional housing for women and children experienc ing domestic 
violence and youth. The NHIF provides concessional loans and grants  for eligible housing 
enabling infrastructure and social and affordable housing . This assistance is also part of the 
Government ’s plan to provide shelter for people in crisis.  
The Government is also expand ing the Affordable Housing Bond Aggregator  by 
increasing Housing Australia ’s liability cap to $10  billion  from $5.5  billion  and lending an 
additional $3 billion to Housing Australia to support ongoing delivery of the program . 
These init iatives will be supp lemented by existing Housing Australia programs that 
provide concessional finance to support more social and affordable homes.  
The Government has provided states and territories with $2  billion  through the Social 
Housing Accelerator P ayment . It will deliver around 4,000 new and refurbished social 
homes.   
As part of the $4  billion , 10-year Northern Territory Homelands and  Housing package , the 
Australian and Northern Territory Governments are working towards a commitment to 
halve overcrowding in the Northern Territory from 55  per cent to 23  per cent by 2034. The Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 4: Meeting Australia's Housing Challenge   |  Page 153 
investment package will deliver up to 270 homes each year and continue urgent repairs 
and maintenance of existing housing and essential infrastructure on homelands.  
The Government is also spending $7  million  to support  building and construction industry 
firms to gain Work Health and Safety (WHS)  accreditation  and $6.2  million  to support 
building industry peak employer associations  to assist their members  in gain ing the WHS 
accreditation required to participate in  Government -funded housing projects . 
Provide  more support to renters  
While new housing supply is being brought online, affordability pressures are likely to 
remain a challenge for many Australians who are renti ng or looking to rent. The 
Government recognises that many renters are under pressure and that rising rents  are 
causing hardship for some Australians and pushing some into insecure housing 
arrangements. The Government is committed to providing more support  to the third of 
Australians who rent. This is being delivered through greater levels of financial assistance, 
working with states and territories to deliver stronger protections for renters and 
facilitating the supply of new rental housing.  
As part of the  Government ’s broader responsible and affordable cost -of-living relief 
package , Commonwealth Rent Assistance  (CRA ) is increas ing by 10  per cent in this 
Budget. Taken alongside the increases in last year ’s Budget and indexation, this will 
increase the maxim um rates of assistance by over 40  per cent. Outside of regular 
indexation, the 2023 –24 Budget and 2024 –25 Budget C RA increases are the first 
back -to-back increases to maximum rates of CRA in three decades . It is also higher than the 
average increase in mar ket rents in this period. It will provide eligible renters with greater 
opportunities to participate in the private rental market.  
Low rental vacancy rates are posing unique challenges for renters. In addition to being 
harder to find a suitable place and placing upward pressures on prices, it limits tenants ’ 
bargaining power with landlords. In recognition of these unique challenges, the 
Government is working with states and territories to strengthen renters ’ rights through the  
Better Deal for Renters p ackage . As part of this package, all levels of government have 
agreed to implement a 9 -point plan that includes:  
• Developing a nationally consistent policy to implement a requirement for genuine 
reasonable grounds for eviction . 
• Moving towards limiting rent increases to once a year . 
• Phasing in minimum rental standards.  
In addition to the broader supply measures the Government is pursuing, the Government 
has a plan to increase the supply of specialist rental accommodation. This will help to 
moderate affordabil ity pressures and introduced more equilibrium between renters and 
landlords.   
 
  |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 154  |  Statement 4: Meeting Australia's Housing Challenge  
Build -to-rent accommodation is designed to be supplied exclusively to the rental market. 
This model, which is much more common in overseas market, is less prevalent in Australia 
where most new developments are build -to-sell properties (i.e. they are built and sold to 
investors or owner -occupiers). To encourage more build -to-rent developments, the 
Government will introduce legislation to offer concessional tax treatment for these 
developments.  
The build -to-rent incentives  includes halving the managed investment trust withholding 
tax rate from 30  per cent to 15  per cent and increasing the capital works tax deduction 
(depreciation) rate from 2.5 to 4  per cent per year for newly constructed build -to-rent 
properties. Analysis commissioned by the Property Council of Australia suggest this could 
unlock 150,000 apartments over  the next decade.35 The Government has also lowered 
foreign investment application fees for new Build to Rent developments and will also allow 
foreign investors to purchase established Build to Rent developments and apply lower fees 
to these applications, conditional on the property continuing to be operated as a Build to 
Rent development.  
Help Australians buy their own homes  
The Government recognises that affordability pressures are being felt by people seeking to 
transition from renting into home ownersh ip. Rising house prices have led to rising 
deposits. This means more Australians are renting for longer, increasing pressure on the 
already constrained rental market. It is harder for people to save enough to clear the 
deposit hurdle and seek the finance n ecessary to enter home ownership.   
To help overcome this challenge, the Government offers potential home buyers the Home 
Guarantee Scheme (the Scheme) . It gives prospective home buyers support to purchase a 
home sooner by reducing the deposit they need to save to buy a house. Participants can 
access the Scheme with a deposit as little as 2  per cent. Around one in three  first 
homebuyers in 2022 –23 were supported by the Scheme.  
The First Home Guarantee component of the Scheme was heavily subscribed by teachers 
(32 per cent of recipients), nurses (24  per cent of recipients) and social workers (19  per cent 
of recipients) .  
Since May  2022, the Scheme has already supported more than 110 ,000 Australians into 
home ownership  and with an expansion to the eligib ility of the Scheme this will continue to 
grow . 
But the Government wants more renters who wish to transition to home ownership to have 
the opportunity to do so. That is why the government has introduced legislation to 
establish Help to Buy . Help to Buy wil l support up to 40,000 eligible households to 
purchase a home by providing them an equity contribution of up to 40  per cent of the 
purchase price for new homes and 30  per cent for existing homes. Participants would also

not be required to pay Lenders Mortg age Insurance, as the equity contribution and their 
deposit would decrease the loan to value ratio to 80  per cent or below.  
Double dedicated homelessness funding and provide shelter for people 
in crisis  
The Government is taking action to  support  people experiencing  hom eless ness  and help 
people in crisis who are finding it difficult to access  shelter and safety , including women 
and children fleeing domestic violence, veterans, and youth . 
The Government has included $9.3 billion  in the Budget for a new  National Agreement on 
Social Housing and Homelessness  with the states and territories . This includes a doubling 
of the Australian  Government ’s dedicated homelessness funding to $400  million  a year .  
Further support will be provided through the additional $1  billion  for the National 
Housing Infrastructure Facility (NHIF),  which will be targeted towards crisis and 
transitional housing for women and children experiencing domestic violence and youth. 
The NHIF provides concessional loans and grants for eligible housing enabling 
infrastructure and social and affordable housing.  This assistance is also part of the 
Governm ent’s plan to deliver more social and affordable homes.  
The Safe Places  program provides capital works grants to support the renovation, building 
or purchase of new emergency accommodation for women and children experiencing 
family and domestic violence. The Safe Places inclusion round grant opportunity will 
provide up to 720  new safe places, bringing the total number of safe places to be delivered 
by the program to around 1,480 across Australia. Projects are expected to commence from 
mid–2024.

Overview  
Since MYEFO, tax receipts excluding GST and  policy decisions have been revised up by 
$27.0 billion over the five years from  2023–24 to 2027 –28, mainly reflecting higher personal 
income tax and company tax . The upgrades to receipts in this Budget are much smaller 
than recent budget updates, at around a fifth of the average of the previous three Budgets.  
Higher employment and continuing strength  in the labour market is a key driver of 
upgrades, accounting for $21.6  billion of the net $27.0  billion upgrade to tax receipts since 
MYEFO. Higher corporate profits make a broadly similar contribution to the upgrade to tax 
receipts. These have been partl y offset by a weaker than expected outlook for tobacco excise 
and superannuation fund earnings.  
Policy decisions are expected to increase  tax receipts by $ 4.9 billion over the five years 
to 2027–28. An overview of key  receipts  measures is provided  in th is statement , with 
detailed information on  all receipts  policy decisions  in Budget  Statement  1 and 
Budget  Paper  No. 2. 
Since MYEFO, non -tax receipts are expected to decrease  by $1.3 billion in 2024 –25 and 
increase by $8.8 billion over the five  years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28.

Tax receipts outlook  
Relative to MYEFO , tax receipts are forecast to be $ 9.0 billion (or  1.4 per cent) higher in 
2024–25, and $ 26.0 billion (or 0.8 per cent) higher over the  five years  from 202 3–24 to  
2027–28. Over half of th is upgrade is in the first two  years of  the forward estimates.  This 
upgrade  reflects a stronger outlook for personal income tax and company tax , partly offset 
by a weaker outlook for super annuation fund  tax, tobacco excis e and GST  receipts . The 
upgrade since MYEFO is driven by continuing strength in the labour market and corporate 
profit s. 
Personal income taxes have been revised up by $ 8.0 billion in 202 4–25 and $ 26.0 billion over 
the five years  from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28. This principally reflects strength in tax withholding 
from salary and wages, supported by a high er level of employment . Relative to MYEFO  
employment reaches a higher level sooner, with smaller expected upgrade s by the end of 
the forward estimates.  
Compan y tax has been revised up by $ 5.5 billion in 202 4–25 and $ 26.2 billion over the five 
years  from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28. Strong corporate  profits , including from iron ore and coal 
prices in late 2023 and the very  early  part of  2024 exceeding those assumed in MYEFO and 
robust demand,  contribute to an upgraded company tax outlook . The stronger company tax 
outlook includes additional tax from  resource  companies that made  significant payments 
when lodging their tax returns last yea r, after previously being in a tax loss position , owing 
to significant past investments.  
Superannuation fund taxes have been revised down by $3.4 billion in 2024 –25 and 
$12.6  billion over the five years  from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28 reflecting lower -than -expected 
collections to date in 2023 –24 and a weaker outlook for  tax from earnings on investments .  
Lower -than -expected  collections of  tobacco excise in 2023–24 coupled with  a weaker 
forecast level of tobacco consumption contribute to a downgrade to tobacco excise  receipts 
of $1.7  billion in 2024 –25 and $12.5  billion over the five years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28.  
GST receipts have been revised down by $9 19.4 million in 2024 –25 and $5.5 billion over the 
five years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28. This is consistent with  the outlook for nominal  
consumption subject to GST , which  has been downgraded since MYEFO owing to weaker  
discretionary  consumption . 
Policy decisions in this Budget focus on reforms to provide cost-of-living relief , support 
investment, promote integrity and tackle fraud . Policy decisions taken since MYEFO  
increase tax receipts by $ 1.7 billion in 202 4–25 and $ 4.9 billion over the five years  from 
2023–24 to 202 7–28. Key policy decisions include:  
•  Personal Income Tax – Cost of Living Tax Cuts 
•  Strengthening Tax Compliance – extending the Shadow Economy Compliance Program  
•  Strengthening Tax Compliance – extending the Tax Avoidance Taskforce   
Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 5: Revenue   |  Page 169 
•  Strengthening the foreign resident capital gains tax regime  
• Small Business Support – $20,000 instant asset write -off.  
In addition to these measures the Government has announced production tax incentives  to 
accelerate investment  in Future Made in Australia  priority industries . While delivered 
through the tax system , these tax credits are treated as expenses for budget purposes .

Box 5.1 Growth in incomes driving  personal income tax  
The resilient  labour market, which has resulted in  stronger  wage  and employment 
growth , is contributing to a rise in personal income tax that is expected to be $ 67 billion 
(26 per cent) higher  on a receipts basis  and $57 billion (20 pe r cent)  on an income year 
basis  in 2024–25 than 20 21–22. Two thirds of the increase  in 2024–25 relative to 2021 –22 is 
driven by strong  expected growth in incomes , while around a quarter  is due to tax filer 
population growth  (Chart  5.1). The impact of bracket creep is much smaller , accounting 
for less than  10 per cent of the forecast increase in 2024 –25. Without the Government ’s 
cost-of-living tax cuts, increases in average tax rates incl uding  bracket creep  would have  
contributed to a third of the personal income tax  increase in 2024–25 relative to 2021 –22.  
Growth in personal income tax is determined by the number of tax filers (driven by 
growth in population  and employment ), income  growth , increases in average tax rates 
(often referred to  as bracket creep)  and changes in tax policy . Chart  5.1 decomposes the 
growth in personal income tax into those components.

Source:  Treasury.  
Note:  Growth in the number of tax filers reflects a combination of population growth, labour force 
participation and other economic factors that affect the number of individuals earning income. Growth in 
average incomes includes the effect of growth in nominal w ages and non -employment incomes, including 
capital gains, business income and dividend income. Bracket creep reflects the increase in the average 
tax rate  due to income growth, as individuals pay a decreasing share of their income at lower marginal tax 
rates, and includes  the effect  of policy changes .  
The chart is prepared on an income year basis, which differs from tax receipts due to differences in when 
tax is incurred compared to when paid .

Box 5.1 Growth in incomes  driving  personal income tax (continued)  
Growth in average incomes is expected to be the largest driver of growth in personal 
income tax, account ing for two third s of the forecast rise  in 2024–25. The average 
income per  tax filer is expected to increase fr om $ 71,000 in 20 21–22 to $80,000 in 
2024–25, which  would contribute an additional $ 36 billion in income tax by 2024 –25 
with constant average tax rates. Growth in average incomes is broad -based over this 
period for workers, business owners and retirees, wit h growth in incomes being 
concentrated in  salary and wages income, business income, and interest income.  
Continuing employment  and population  growth , which  increas es the number of tax 
filers , is expected to account for around a quarter of the forecast  rise in personal 
income taxes  in 2024–25. The 6 per cent increase in tax filers , primarily from  strong 
employment  growth , contribute s a further $ 16 billion in income tax  in 2024–25. The 
vast majority of additional tax filers have been  wage and salary earners .  
Policy changes significantly reduce the effect of  bracket creep in 2024–25, especially  
the Government ’s cost -of-living tax cuts  that will deliver a tax cut to every 
Australian taxpayer from 1  July 2024 and reduce the personal income tax take by 
$23 billion in 2024 –25. This policy change means, that despite continuing to forecast  
strength in the labour market , personal income tax receip ts are expect ed to be lower 
in 2024–25 than in  2023–24.

Since MYEFO , parameter and other variations have increased total receipts by $ 5.5 billion 
in 202 4–25 and $ 23.8 billion over the five years  from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28. Policy decisions 
increase total receipts by $ 2.2 billion in 202 4–25 and $ 8.1 billion over the five years  from 
2023–24 to 2027 –28 compared with MYEFO . The upgrade to the forecasts of total receipts 
overwhelmingly reflects upgrades to the forecasts of tax receipts.  
Tax receipts estimates  
Relative to  MYEFO , forecasts of tax receipts have been revised up by $ 9.0 billion in 202 4–25 
and by $ 26.0 billion over the five years  from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28.

Changes in the outlook for individual heads of revenue are explained in more detail below.  
Individuals and other withholding taxes  
Since MYEFO , total individuals and other withholding tax receipts have been revised up by 
$8.0 billion in 202 4–25 and $ 26.0 billion over the five years  from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28. 
Individuals and other withholding tax receipts are expected to fall in 2024–25 with delivery 
of the Government ’s cost -of-living tax cut for every Australian taxpayer . 
Excluding new policy decisions, individuals and other withholding tax receipts have been 
revised up by $ 6.7 billion in 202 4–25 and $ 25.1 billion over  the five years  from 202 3–24 to 
2027–28.  
Income tax withholding ( predominantly tax on salary and wages) has been revised  up by 
$5.8 billion in 202 4–25 and $ 21.6 billion over the five years  from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28 
excluding policy decisions. This reflects strength in year -to-date collections , which have 
been supported by stronger -than -expected employment growth  and a pick -up in wage 
growth . In annual terms , the upgrade  over the forward estimates  peaks in 2025–26 
consistent with the forecast  moderati on of employment growth .   
Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 5: Revenue   |  Page 175 
Net other individuals  (gross other individuals less refunds)  has been revised up by 
$855.2 million in 202 4–25 and up $3.5 billion over the five years  from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28 
excluding policy decisions. This largely  reflects moderately higher than expected income on 
tax returns t hat boosts receipts in the first part of the forward estimates . This is then 
expected to unwind from 2025 –26 in line with a  weaker  outlook for income  flowing to 
individuals from unincorporated businesses and investments .  
New tax policy measures announced since MYEFO  are expected to incre ase individuals 
and other withholding tax receipts by $ 1.3 billion in 202 4–25 and $857.7 million over the 
five years  from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28.  
Fringe benefits tax  
Since  MYEFO , fringe benefits tax receipts have been revised up by $ 80.0 million in 
2024–25 and $ 470.0 million over the five years  from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28. This reflects 
continuing strength in the labour market .  
Company tax  
Since MYEFO , company tax receipts have been revised up to be $ 5.5 billion higher in 
2024–25 and $ 26.2 billion higher over the five years  from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28. 
Excluding new policy decisions, company tax has been revised up by $ 5.6 billion in   
2024–25 and $ 23.8 billion over the five years  from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28.  
The upgra de across the forward estimate s reflects strong corporate profits  flowing through 
to higher  pay-as-you-go instalments. Mining company profits are relatively unchanged  in 
aggregate over the forward estimates , with higher commodity prices in the near  term offset  
by lower export volume s in all years . Despite this, the resources sector  contributes to  the 
company tax upgrade due to  large  companies moving to a tax paying position after 
exhausting  prior year losses (see Box 5.2). Strength in company tax receipts in later years of 
the forward estimates is also supported by an improved outlook for the non -mining sector.  
New tax policy measures announced since  MYEFO  are expected to decrease company tax 
receipts by $ 68.5 million in 202 4–25 but increase co mpany tax receipts by $ 2.4 billion over 
the five years  from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28.

Box 5. 2 Contribution to company income tax from the oil and gas sector  
The mining sector is a significant contributor to company income tax (company tax) ; 
estimated to contribute two -fifths of company tax payable in 2022 –23. Mining sector 
profits are closely tied to volatile commodity prices, which poses significant 
challenges for forecasting near -term company tax receipts. After mining, t he next 
largest  contribution to total company tax is from the finance industry.  
Sustained high export prices , particularly in 2022,  spiked  income  for mining  
companies , which led to  several large oil and gas extraction companies making  large  
company  tax payments on 1  June  2023. In many cases, these companies had never 
previously paid company tax, and were not expected to pay  any tax  in the near term.  
Significant capital investments in liquified natural gas (LNG) projects in Australia 
were made between 2010 and 2019. LNG projects are highly capital intensive due to 
the requirements for processing and liquefaction in addition to field and pipeline 
costs. As a result, LNG ex porting companies accrued a significant stock of tax losses 
that have been carried forward to offset income in later years, which has kept 
company tax liabilities low (see Chart  5.4).  
However, the unprecedented shock to the global LNG market from the war in Ukraine 
caused total income for the oil and gas sector in 2022 –23 to increase by 67 per cent. For 
some large LNG exporting companies in 2022 –23, elevated profits exceeded their stock 
of company tax losses. These companies, who were previously expected t o 
individually enter the tax system over several years, now had significant company  tax 
liabilities for the 2022 –23 income year (see Chart  5.5).

Box 5.2 Contribution to company income tax from the oil and gas sector 
(continued)  
Based on the current price outlook, these companies are expected to continue paying 
company tax  given their stock of tax losses has been exhausted, leading to a 
sustained increase in the company tax base.  
Some of these companies also operate projects subject to the Petroleum Resource 
Rent Tax (PRRT ) which  imposes an additional tax on  profits f rom the sale of offshore 
petroleum products . The Government has introduced to Parliament further changes 
to the PRRT to deliver a fairer return to the Australian community from the offshore 
gas sector, including a cap  on the use of deductions. These changes will ensure  the 
offshore LNG industry pays  more tax, sooner, while  providing industry and 
investors policy certainty to allow the sufficient supply of domestic gas, and 
ensuring  Australia remains a reliable internat ional energy supplier and investment 
partner.  
 
Superannuation fund taxes  
Since MYEFO , superannuation fund tax receipts have been revised down by $3. 4 billion in 
2024–25 and $ 12.6 billion across the five years  from 202 3–24 to 2027–28. Excluding new 
policy decisions, the downgrade is $3.4  billion in 2024 –25 and $12.8 billion over the five 
years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28. 
Superannuation fund taxes have been revised down in 202 3–24 in line with weaker fund 
earnings and higher -than -expected r efunds. Weakness in tax from  fund earnings is 
expected to persist over the forward estimates, with a n updated  outlook for net foreign 
income , capital gains and foreign exchange gains and losses contributing to the downgrade . 
Strength in the labour market drives  a partially offsetting improvement to superannuation 
contributions  taxes , although the extent of this  improvement  diminishes  over the forward 
estimates .  
New tax policy measures announced since MYEFO  are expected to  have a negligible 
increase to superannuation fund taxes receipts in 202 4–25 but increase superannuation 
fund taxes receipts by $ 177.0 million over the five years  from 202 3–24 to 202 7–28.  
Petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT)  
Since  MYEFO , PRRT receipts have been revised up by $ 400.0 million in 202 4–25 and 
revised down by  $750.0  million over the five years  from 202 3–24 to 202 7–28. The 
downgrade over the forward estimates is driven by lower  oil prices than assumed at 
MYEFO.   
The downgrade to PRRT receipts in 20 23–24, and subsequent upgrade  in 2024–25, reflect s 
the delay in  the passage of  legislation  for the 2023 –24 Budget measure Petroleum Resource 
Rent Tax – Government Response to the Review of the PRRT Gas Transfer Pricing arrangement .  
  |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 178  |  Statement 5: Revenue  
The first tax payments  from this measure are now expected in 2024 –25 rather than 2023 –24. 
This is only a change in timing and  does not change  the total expected receipts from this 
measure of $2.4  billion from 2023 –24 to 2026–27. 
Goods and services tax (GST)  
Since MYEFO , GST receipts have been revised down by $919.4 million in 2024–25 and 
$5.5 billion over the five years  from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28.  
Excluding new policy decisions, GST has been revised down by $ 914.4 million in 2024–25 
and $5.9 billion over the five years  from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28. GST receipts have been 
upgraded in 2023–24 due to stronger -than -expected year -to-date collections . From 2024 –25 
the downgrade is driven by the lower outlook for  nominal consumption subject to GST , 
partia lly offset by higher nominal dwelling investment . 
New tax policy measures announced since  MYEFO  are expected to decrease  GST receipts 
by $5.0 million in 202 4–25 but increase GST receipts by  $400.1 million over the five years  
from 202 3–24 to 202 7–28.  
Excise and customs duty  
Since  MYEFO , total excise and customs duty receipts have been revised down by 
$1.8 billion in 2024–25 and $ 11.9 billion over the five years  from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28.  
Excluding new policy decisions, excise and customs duty receipts have been revised down  
by $1.9 billion in 2024–25 and $ 11.5 billion over the five years  from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28. This 
overwhelmingly reflects the significant downward revision to tobacco  excise receipts . This 
revision is due to a combination of weaker -than -expected  tobacco  imports in 2023 –24 and a 
larger  expected decline in tobacco consumption over the forward estimates . 
Policy decisions are expected to increase  excise and customs duty receipts by $ 123.3 million 
in 202 4–25 but decrease by $388.7 million over the five years  from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28. This 
is primarily lower fuel excise receipts due to  the introduction of  a New Vehicle Efficien cy 
Standard . 
The 2024–25 Budget estimates continue to include provision for the Australia European 
Union Free Trade Agreement, which has not been finalised. This provision is assumed to 
impact customs duty receipts. No other Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) that are currently 
under negotiation are expected to have a material impact on revenue over the forward 
estimates. A full list of FTAs currently under negotiation is available on the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade website.  
Other taxes  
Other taxes encompass a range of sou rces of receipts, including visa application charges, 
major bank levy, luxury car tax, wine equalisation tax and agricultural levies.   
Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 5: Revenue   |  Page 179 
Since MYEFO , other tax receipts have been revised up by $1.0 billion in 202 4–25 and 
$4.1 billion over the five years  from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28. New tax policy measures 
announced since MYEFO  are expected to decrease other tax receipts by $ 57.4 million in 
2024–25 and $ 76.4 million over the five years  from 2023–24 to 2027 –28.  
Non–tax receipts estimates  
Since MYEFO, non -tax receipts are expected to decrease by $1.3  billion in 2024 –25 and 
increase by $8.8  billion over the five years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28. 
Since MYEFO, parameter and other variations are expected to decrease non -tax rec eipts by 
$1.8 billion in 2024 –25 and increase non -tax receipts by $5.6  billion over the five years from 
2023–24 to  2027–28. This movement is partially driven  by the Commonwealth 
Superannuation Corporation reprofiling the transfer of funded benefits to the Consolidated 
Revenue Fund, earnings from the Future Fund and Australian  Government Investment 
Funds , and interest on cash deposits. In addition, non -tax receipts have been revised up by 
$2.9 billion in 2027 –28 to account for the difference between the medium -term projection 
methodology at MYEFO and the forward estimate in this Budget. This increase in non -tax 
receipts is partially offset by revised assumptions under the Unclaimed Superannuation 
Monies program, reflecting less money in unclaimed superann uation accounts and greater 
amounts being reunited with active superannuation funds.  
Since MYEFO, policy decisions are expected to increase non -tax receipts by $0.5  billion in 
2024–25, and by $3.2  billion over the five  years from 2023 –24 to 2027–28.

Variations in revenue estimates  
The revenue estimates are the accrual accounting equivalent of the cash -based receipts 
estimates. Changes in revenue are generally driven by the same factors as receipts.  
Revenues are usually higher than the cash equivalents because the amounts are generally 
recognised when they are owed rather than whe n they are paid. The differences between 
the accrual and cash amounts therefore generally reflect payment timing differences. 
Table  5.8 provides a reconciliation of the 2024–25 Budget revenue estimates with those at  
the 2023–24 Budget and  MYEFO .

Appendix A: Tax Expenditures  
This appendix contains an overview of Australian Government tax expenditures. Section  12 
of the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998  requires the publication of an overview of 
estimated tax expenditures.  
The Government published the 2023 –24 Tax Expenditures and Insights Statement (TEIS) 
on 31 January  2024 . The TEIS provides an estimate of the revenue forgone from tax 
expenditures, along with distributional analysis on large tax expenditures and commonly 
utilised features of the tax system.  
Tax benchmarks represent a standard tax treatment that applies to similar taxpayers or 
types of activities. Policy approaches can apply a tax treatment different from a standard 
approach, which can give rise to positive or negative tax expenditures. The choice of 
benchmark unavoidably involves some judgment.  
Consistent w ith most OECD countries, estimates of tax expenditures reflect the extent to 
which they are used, similar to Budget estimates of outlays on demand -driven expenditure 
programs. This is known as the ‘revenue forgone ’ approach which, in practice, involves 
estimating the difference in revenue between the actual and benchmark tax treatments but, 
importantly, assuming taxpayer behaviour is the same in each circumstance. Revenue  
forgone estimates therefore do not indicate the revenue gain to the Budget if a specif ic tax 
expenditure was abolished through policy change, as there may be significant changes in 
taxpayer behaviour.  
Care needs to be taken when comparing tax expenditures with direct expenditures as they 
may measure different things. In addition, estimates from different editions of previously 
released Statements are generally not directly comparable, because of changes or 
modifications to —for example —benchmarks, individual tax expenditures, data used or 
modelling methodology.  
Table  A.1 lists the largest mea sured tax expenditures for 2023 –24 and several personal 
deduction categories. It is derived from the 2023 –24 TEIS and is based on economic 
parameters as at the publication of MYEFO. It does not include the impact of policy 
decisions, or changes in the econ omic outlook since then on tax expenditures. The TEIS is 
not a statement of policy intent.  
The 2023 –24 TEIS also contains distributional analysis on some features of the tax system, 
including deductions for individuals. The items in the deductions categor y are not tax 
expenditures so they do not result in forgone revenue against the benchmark. However, the 
difference between tax paid with the deduction and tax that would have been paid if the 
deduction was not claimed has been included in Table  A.1 for com parison purposes.

Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment   |  Page 189 Statement 6:  
Expenses and Net Capital Investment  
This Statement presents estimates of Australian Government general government sector 
expenses  and net capital investment , disaggregated into various functions of government,  
on an  accrual accounting basis . The Government also reports spending on an underlying 
cash  basis (including details about payments) in Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook . 
The Government  is focused on responsible economic management , responding to the 
challenges of today and investing in a better future . In this Budget, t he Government  is 
invest ing to deal with unavoidable spending , easing  cost-of-living  pressures , building more 
homes for Australians , investing in a Future Made in Australia, strengthen ing Medicare 
and the care economy , and broadening  opportunity and advanc ing equali ty. 
General government sector expenses are expected to remain broadly  stable  as a proportion 
of GDP over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28, reflecting the Government ’s commitment to 
provide support  to ease  cost-of-living  pressures on businesses and households  and build a 
stronger foundation for sustainable economic growth. Total expenses are expected to be  
26.6 per cent of GDP in 2024 –25 and to remain around that level o ver the period 2024 –25 to 
2027 –28. 
Significant areas of expenditure in 2024 –25 will be in the social security and welfare  
(36.3 per cent of total expenses), health  (15.3 per cent of total expenses), education  
(7.2 per cent of total expenses) and defence  (6.5 per cent of total expenses)  functions . 
Together, these functions account for approximately 65 per cent of all government expenses 
in 2024 –25. 
Real growth in expenses  over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28 is expected to  average 
2.0 per cent per  year . The strongest real growth across the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28 is 
expected to occur in the defence  (6.3 per cent) and social security and welfare (5.6 per cent) 
functions . 
Major  expense trends over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28 include movements in the 
following functions . 
Social security and welfare : the increase in expenses  is largely due to the Government ’s 
ongoing investment in assistance to people with disability , both through the N ational 
Disability Insurance Scheme  and the Disability Support pension , and through  funding 
under the Aged Care  Services program. Expenses for services and payments, including 
JobSeeker  Payment and income support and compensation payments to veterans  are 
expected to increase over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28, as more recipients can more easily 
access government services.   
Page 190  |  Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  Defence : the increase in expenses reflects that under the 2024 National Defence Strategy  and 
the Integrated Investment Program , the Government will invest to accelerate the delivery of 
defence  capabilities to support an integrated, focused force that is better positioned to 
safeguard Australia ’s security and prosperity.  
Education : the increase in expenses reflect s the Government ’s continued investment in 
improving  education outcomes and supporting schools,  higher education, and vocational 
education programs. Expenditure is driven by more funding to states and s tudent 
enrolment growth, including higher enrolment rates for ‘students w ith disability ’, which 
will drive expenses for schools. Increased funding for universities and vocational education 
under the Australian Universities Accord  and National Skills Agreement  and the changes to 
indexation arrangements  for outstanding debt for s tudent loans are also estimated to  
increase expenses . 
Mining , manufacturing and construction : the increase in expenses reflects the 
Government ’s continued investment in Australia ’s mining, manufacturing and 
construction industries. Expenses for the Research and Development Tax Incentive 
continue to increase to support the research and development that is key to boosting the 
competitiveness and productivity of industry.   
Fuel and energy : the increase in expenses in 2024 –25 for renewable energy investments 
reflects the Government ’s commitment to growing Australia ’s renewable energy  
capabilities through concessional loans made by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation  
under Powering Au stralia – Rewiring the Nation . In the 2024 –25 Budget , the Government is 
also investing  in the Future Made in Australia  agenda  which  includes  further  Government 
investments into renewable energy and technology, which will develop new clean energy 
industries and supply chains and contribute to Australia ’s efforts towards achieving a 
global net zero economy . The Government is also  extend ing and expanding  the Energy Bill 
Relief Fund  to deliver cost -of-living relief to all Aust ralian  households  and eligible 
businesses.  
Housing  and community amenities : the Government is providing target ed upfront 
investments into building more homes and liveable communities, and ensuring Australians 
have safe, secure, and affordable homes. I n the  2024 –25 Budget, the Government is 
providing further support through the new National Agreement on Social Housing and 
Homelessness , enabling infrastructure through the Housing Support Program, and the 
investments through the Housing Australia Future Fund.  
Figures in the tables and text, and the analysis of trends, are presented in nominal terms, 
except in circumstances where real values are explicitly stated.

pressures, build more homes for Australians, create  a Future Made in Australia, strengthen 
Medicare and the care economy, and broaden  opportunity and advance e quality.

Statement 6: Expenses and Ne t Capital Investment   |  Page 195 
Economic parameters are estimated to decrease expenses by $8.0  billion over the four  years 
from 2023 –24 to 2026 –27 compared with  the 2023 –24 MYEFO, reflecting lower projections 
for prices and wages , and lower projections  for GST payments to the st ates on account of 
lower projections for consumption.  
Program specific parameter variations are projected to increase expenses by $35.7 billion 
over the four years from 2023 –24 to 2026 –27 compared with the 2023 –24 MYEFO. This 
includes major variation s in the following programs : 
• Expenses related to the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) are estimated to 
increase by $11.1 billion over four years from 2023 –24 to 2026 –27 (and $4.5 billion in 
2027 –28), based on revised projections from the NDIS Actuary and adjustments related 
to in-kind support s. The NDIS legislative reforms being undertaken by the Government 
as part of the  2024 –25 Budget measure  National Disability Insurance Scheme – Getting the 
NDIS back on track  are expected to offset the increase projected by the NDIS Actuary , 
moderate this additional growth in NDIS expenses  from 2024 –25, to keep NDIS 
expenditure on track to achieve the NDIS Sustainability Framework from 1  July 2026.  
• Expenses related to the Mili tary Rehabilitation Compensation Act – Income Support 
and Compensation are expected to increase  by $5.7 billion over the four years from 
2023 –24 to 2026 –27, largely due to more claims being processed because of increased 
staffing levels that the Government  has agreed to in order to deliver on its commitment 
to clear the claims backlog . 
• Expenses related to the Child Care Subsidy are expected to increase by  $2.6 billion over 
the four years from 2023 –24 to 2026 –27, largely reflecting additional support flowing to 
families due to the higher costs of providing care.  
• Expenses related to JobSeeker Income Support are expected to increase by $1.4 billion 
over the four years from 2023 –24 to 2026 –27, largely due to upward revisions to the 
expected number of reci pients and average payment rates , driven by changes to the 
composition of payment recipients.  
Since the 2023 –24 MYEFO, other variations ( -$5.4 billion), variations associated with Public 
Debt Interest ( -$1.2 billion) and program specific  parameter  variations ($ 35.7 billion) have 
increased  expenses by $ 29.1 billion over the four years to 2026 –27.

Estimated expenses by function  
Estimates of general government sector  expenses by function for the period 202 3–24 to 
2027–28 are set out in Table 6.3. The social security and welfare, health, education and 
defence functions account for  approximately 65 per cent of all government expenses in 
2024–25 (see Box 6. 1). Changes to the levels of expenditure within  these functions 
significantly affect  total government spending. Further details of spending trends in all 
functions are set out under individual function headings.

Box 6.1: Where does government spending go in 2024 –25? 
Government spending provides a wide range of services to the community. The 
most signific ant component of government spending relates to social security and 
welfare, with over one third of total expenses providing support to the aged, families 
with children, people with disabilities, veterans, carers and unemployed people.  
Around a seventh of government expenses occur in health, including spending on 
the Medicare Benefits Schedule and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.  
The Government also provides significant investment in education, supporting 
government and non -government schools, as well as  higher education and 
vocational education and training.  
Defence is another significant component of government expenditure, providing 
capability to the Australian Defence Force to protect Australia ’s security and defend 
our national interests.

General government sector expenses  
General public services  
The general public services function includes expenses to support the organisation and 
operation of government . These expenses include those relating to  the Parliament , the 
Governor -General , the conduct of elections , the collection of taxes and management of 
public funds and  debt , assistance to developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve 
sustainable development  (particularly countries in the Pacific region ), contributions to 
international organisations , and foreign affairs.  
The general public services function also inc ludes expenses related to research in areas not 
otherwise connected with a specific function  (including research undertaken by  the 
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Australian Nuclear 
Science and Technology Organisation, the  Australian  Institute of Marine Science, and the 
Australian  Research Council ), those associated with overall economic and statistical 
services, as well as government superannuation benefits (excluding nominal interest 
expenses on unfunded liabilities, whic h are included under the nominal superannuation 
interest sub -function in the other purposes function).

a) A further breakdown of the foreign affairs and economic aid sub function is provided in Table 6.4. 1. 
b) A further breakdown of the general research sub function is provided in Table 6.4. 2. 
 
Total general public services  expenses are estimated to decrease by 1.7 per cent over the 
period  from 2024 –25 to 2027 –28. 
The largest movement in expenses for the general public services function is an expected 
increase for government superannuation benefits , with other significant movements in 
spending on legislative and executive affairs, general research  and foreign affairs and 
econom ic aid . The remaining sub -function s are expected to remain broadly stable over the 
period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28. 
Legislative and executive affairs  expenses largely reflect the  maintenance  of parliamentary 
functions and personnel, and the expenditure profile of the Australian Electoral 
Commission. The decrease in expenses from 2024 –25 reflects the reduction in estimated 
Australian Electoral Commission expenses following the federal election  in 2024 –25.  
Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 6: Expenses and Ne t Capital Investment   |  Page 201 
Financial  and fiscal affairs  expenses are expected to decrease, reflecting the termination of 
a number of Australian Taxation Office  programs.  In the 2024 –25 Budget, the Government 
is extend ing several terminating  ATO  compliance programs, to ensur e multinationals, 
businesses and individuals are paying the right amount of tax in Australia.  
Foreign affairs and economic aid  expenses are expected to fluctuate over the period from 
2024 –25 to 2027 –28. This largely reflect s the payment cycles of Austr alia’s contributions 
under funding arrangements for multilateral funds, with a significant increase in expenses 
for Official Development Assistance in 2024 –25, in line with previously agreed 
arrangements.  Government decisions  in the 2024 –25 Budget  to continue and expand 
programs supporting Southeast Asia , build on relationships  in the Pacific , and 
strength ening the capability of the  Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade , are also 
expected to contribute to growth in expenses across the period 202 5–26 to 2027 –28.

(ODA), which is in cash terms. Aid spending by other entities is usually ref lected in other sub -functions . 
c) Diplomacy includes departmental expenditure for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ’s 
operations, security and IT, overseas property and international climate change engagement.  
 
General research  expenses  are expecte d to decrease over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28, 
attributable to fluctuations in funding allocated to research infrastructure programs, and 
the reprioritisation of funding to realign investment with Government priorities in the 
Industry portfolio.

Expenses for general services  are largely incurred by the Department of Finance, 
Australian Public Service Commission, and Comcare. General services  expens es are 
estimated to remain broadly stable over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28. The variation in the 
expenses profile  over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28 largely reflects the impact of insurance 
claims expenditure and terminating departmental funding measures . 
The higher estimated expenses in 2023 –24 for government superannuation benefits  
primarily reflects the use of different discount rates. In accordance with accounting 
standards, superannuation expenses for 2023 –24 are calculated using the long -term 
govern ment bond rate that best matched each individual scheme ’s duration of liabilities at 
the start of the financial year. These rates are between 4.0 and 4.4 per cent per  year . In 
preparing the latest Long Term Cost Reports, the scheme actuaries have determined that a 
discount rate of 5.0  per cent should be applied to the 2024 –25 Budget year and forward 
estimates as per usual practice.  
Defence  
The defence function includes expenses incurred by the Department of Defence (Defence) 
and other agencies that support National Defence. Defence expenses support:  
• Australian military operations ; and  
• National Defence , through strategic policy advice and the delivery of capabilities to 
achieve an integrated and focused force, harnessing effects across the maritime, land, 
air, space, and cyber domains.   
Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 6: Expenses and Ne t Capital Investment   |  Page 203 
The defence  function does not include expenses incurred by the Department of Veterans ’ 
Affairs, superannuation payments to retired military personnel, related nominal 
superannuation interest, and housing assistance prov ided through Defence Housing 
Australia. These expenses are reported in the social security and welfare, general public 
services, other purposes, and housing and community amenities functions, respectively.

Total expenses for the defence  sub-function are estimated to increase by 14.8 per cent over 
the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28. This change  reflect s the funding required to deliver Defence 
capabilities to support an integrated, focused force that is positioned to safeguard 
Australia ’s security and prosperity.  
Underpinne d by the 2024 National Defence Strategy  and Integrated Investment Program,  the 
Government will adopt a whole -of-government and whole -of-nation approach to 
protecting our economic connection to the world, upholding the global rules -based order, 
maintaining a favourable regional strategic  balance, and contributing to the collective 
security of the Indo -Pacific.  
In the 2024 –25 Budget, the Government is delivering increased funding of $50.3  billion over 
ten years from 2024 –25, and $7.7  billion per year ongoing, to support a shift in Defence ’s 
force structure and posture, and the capability investments prioritised in the 2024 National 
Defence Strategy  and Integrated Investment Program . 
The Government has also committed to further spending to support the strategic objectives 
of the 2024 Nationa l Defence Strategy , including: $ 232.3  million over three years to provide 
Defence Assistance  – regional and global support ; and $166.2  million over five years from  
2023 –24 to strengthen Australia ’s defence industrial base through the 2024 Defence Industry 
Development Strategy . 
Public order and safety  
The public order and safety function includes expenses to support the administration of the 
federal legal system and the provision of legal services, including legal aid, to the

a) A further breakdown of the other public order and safety sub -function is provided in Table  6.6.1.  
 
Total expenses for public order and safety are estimated to decrease by 19.8 per cent  over 
the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28, largely driven by expenses for other public order and 
safety . 
Courts and legal services  expenses are expected to decrease over the period 2024 –25 to 
2027 –28, reflecting the expiration of the National Legal Assistance Partnership on 
30 June  2025 , noting  negotiations on the next agreement  will begin shortly . 
The profile of other public order and safety  expenses is due in large part to two factors. 
First, from 2025 –26 onwards, funding terminates for some National Partnership Payments 
for public order and safety. This funding will be conside red by the Government in future 
economic updates. Second, consistent with past practice, supplementary funding is 
provided to the Australian Border Force on an annual basis for border protection activities, 
based on operational requirements. In the 2024 –25 Budget, the supplementary increase to 
border protection funding is $266.7 million, bringing the total funding for 2024 –25 to 
$2.0 billion.

The education function includes expenses to support the delivery of education services 
through higher education institutions , vocational education and training providers 
(including technical and further education institutions) , and government (state and 
territory) and non -government primary and secondary schools.

Total education  49,099  53,046  53,220  55,093  56,925  
Total education expenses are  estimated to increase by 7.3 per cent over the period 2024 –25 
to 2027 –28, reflecting the Government ’s ongoing investment in schools, higher education, 
and vocational education  and training  programs . 
The main movements in expenses for the education function are attributable to schools  
(comprising  non-government schools and government schools ), along with higher 
education and student assistance . The remaining sub -functions are expected to remain 
broadly stable over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28. 
Higher education  expenses are estimated to increase over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28, 
primarily driven by growth in fu nding for Commonwealth  supported study places at 
universities.  The Government is also increasing the number of Commonwealth supported 
places for fee -free university preparation courses through the 2024 –25 Budget measure 
Australian Universities Accord  – tertiary education system reforms . 
Vocational and other education  expenses are estimated to remain broadly stable  across the 
period  2024 –25 to 2027 –28. This reflects the profile of  Government  investment in vocational 
education and training under the 5-year  National Skills Agreement , which  commenced from 
1 January  2024.  
Non -government schools  expenses are estimated to increase over the period 2024 –25 to 
2027 –28. This is primarily driven by growth in student enrolments, largely due to a one -off 
change to enrolment projection methodology.  
Government schools  expenses are estimated to increase over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28 
primarily reflect ing an increase in the number of students that are eligible to attract a 
‘student with disability ’ loading.   
  |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 206  |  Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  
Fluctuat ions in student assistance  expenses  reflect  the Government ’s decision to  change 
indexation arrangements for  outstanding debt for student loans from 1 June 2023 through 
the 2024 –25 Budget measure Australian Universities Accord  – tertiary education system reforms. 
This measure results in a large , one -off increase in expenses in 2024 –25 when students will 
receive an indexation credit to their outstanding debt for prior year indexation adjustments. 
Excluding this one -off expense, student assistance  expenses are estimated to increase over 
the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28 primarily driven by growth in student numbers  over the 
period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28. 
Health  
The health function includes expenses relating to  medical services funded through  
Medicare , payments to the states and territories to deliver essential health services  
(including public hospitals ), the Pharmaceutical Benefits and Repatriation Pharmaceutical 
Benefits Schemes , the Private Health Insurance Rebate , Aboriginal and Torres  Strait 
Islander health programs, mental health services , and health workforce initiatives.

b) A further breakdown of the pharmaceutical benefits and services sub -function is provided in Table  6.8.2.  
c) The hospital services sub -function predominantly reflects Commonwealth funding to the states and 
territories  for veterans ’ hospital services.  
 
Expenses for the health function are expected to increase by 9 .0 per cent over the period 
2024 –25 to 2027 –28. The largest movement in expenses for the health function is estimated 
to occur in assistance to the states for public hospitals , with other significant movements 
in medical services and benefits  and health services . Expens es for the remaining 
sub-functions are expected to largely remain stable  over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28. 
Medical services and benefits  expenses , which primarily consists of Medica l Benefits and 
Private Health Insurance expenses, comprises 36. 6 per cent of total estimated  health 
expenses for 2024 –25. Expenses are  expected to increase over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28, 
primarily  drive n by growth in  the Medica l Benefits  component . The increase  is a result of 
ongoing growth in the use of medical services, particularly primary care and diagnostic 
imaging services , mostly  driven by population growth .

Pharmaceutical benefits and services  expenses , which primarily consists  of 
Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme expenses, comprises 18.3  per cent of total estimated health 
expenses for 2024 –25. The Government is investing $ 3.9 billion over five years from  
2023 –24 through a range of 2024 –25 Budget measures to ensur e ongoing affordable  access 
to medicines . This includes new and amended listing s on the Pharmaceutical Benefits 
Scheme and investment in the community pharmacy sector through the 2024 –25 Budget 
measure  Securing Cheaper Medicines . In real terms, expenditure is  expected to decr ease over 
the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28, primarily driven by the impact of existing pricing polices 
under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme component , which result s in decreases to the 
price of subsidised medicines .

The Government ’s contribution to public hospitals is reported th rough the assistance to the 
states for public hospitals  sub-function. Hospital services covered by this sub -function 
include all admitted services, programs that deliver hospital services in the home, and 
emergency department servic es. Expenditure for this sub -function is expected to increase 
reflecting the Government ’s current agreement under the 2020 –2025 N ational Health 
Reform Agreement  Addendum with states and territories.  
Health  services  include expenses associated with the delivery of population health, 
medical research, mental health, blood and blood products, other allied health services, 
health infrastructure and disbursements from the Medical Research Future Fund.  Expenses 
are expected to decrease as a result of a number  of terminating measures  for preventive 
health and chronic disease . Funding for terminating measures will be considered in future 
economic updates. The decrease in expenses is partly offset by increases  in estimated 
expenses for blood products and mental h ealth.  
Expenses for  general administration  include the Government ’s general administrative 
costs associated with health and aged care, funding for primary health care and 
coordination, investment in health workforce measures, and support for rural health 
initiatives. Expenditure for this sub -function is expected to decrease for the period 2024 –25 
to 2027 –28, largely reflecting the gradual scaling down of the Government ’s COVID -19 
pandemic response, and the completion of ICT projects to deliver essen tial enhancements 
to critical aged care digital systems.  
Expenditure for Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander health  is expected to increase from 
2023 –24 to 2024 –25, reflecting the Government ’s commitment to closing the gap for First 
Nations people ’s heal th and wellbeing. Expenses are expected to marginally  decrease  over 
the period 2024 –25 to 202 7–28, reflect ing a number of  terminat ing measures . Funding for 
terminating measures will be considered in future economic updates.

Expenses in social security and welfare are estimated to  increase  by 14.0 per cent over the 
period 202 4–25 to 202 7–28. The largest movement s in expenses for social security and 
welfare are expected to occu r in relation to  assistance to the aged  and assistance to people 
with disabilities . Significant movements are also expected to  occur in assistance to 
veterans and dependants  and assistance to  families with children . The remaining 
sub-functions are estimated to remain broadly stable over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28. 
The expected increase in expenses for social security and welfare is primarily driven by 
expenses for participant supports throu gh the National Disability Insurance Scheme  
(NDIS) , more payments made to veterans and their families as outstanding claims for 
rehabilitation and compensation are processed,  and an expected increase in support for 
seniors and aged care services expenses.  
Assistance to the aged  expenses  are estimated to increase  over the period 2024 –25 to  
2027 –28, primarily driven by increases in expenditure in the Aged Care Services 
component and the Support for Seniors component . 
The Support for Seniors  component  is estimated to  increase  over  the period  2024 –25 to 
2027 –28 reflecting the expected increase in the number of Age Pension recipients as the 
Australian population  ages.  
   
  |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 210  |  Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  
The significant drivers of growth in the Aged Care Services  component  are the expanding 
ageing population and rising demand for aged care services. In the 2024 –25 Budget, the 
Government  is provid ing $0.5 billion to release 24,100 additional Home Care Packages in 
2024 –25 to reduce wait times and meet the growing de mand for care at home.

Assistance to veterans and dependants  expenses are estimated to increase over the period 
from 2024 –25 to 2027 –28, which largely reflects increasing  expenses for income support and 
compensation payments to veterans under the Military Rehabilitation Compensation Act 2004  
as more claims are processed . In the 2024 –25 Budget, the Government  is provid ing 
additional resources for frontline support to prioritise processing of outstanding claims  for 
veterans and their families now that the Department of Veterans ’ Affairs has cleared the 
claims backlog . Expenses  are projected to peak in 2025 –26 and then return to a steady state 
in 202 6–27 once the outstanding permanent impairment claims have been processed . 
Assistance to people with disabilities  expenses are expected to increase over the period 
2024–25 to 2027 –28, largely reflecting an increase in the number of people with disability 
participating in  the NDIS and increases in individual support costs.  
On 27  March  2024, the Government introduced the National Disability Insurance Scheme 
Amendment (Getting the NDIS Back on Track No. 1) Bill 2024 . NDIS legislative reforms are 
expected to moderate the additional growth in NDIS expenditure from 2024 –25 projected 
by the NDIS Actuary to that projected at the 2023 –24 MYEFO, to keep NDIS expenditure on 
track to achieve the NDIS Sustainability Framework from 1  July 2026.

Social Services . 
 
Assistance to families with children  expenses are expected to increase over the period 
2024 –25 to 2027 –28. 
The expected i ncrease  in assistance to families with children  expenses reflect increases  in 
Parental Leave Pay  expenses, including an increase in both the number of recipients and 
the average payment rates.  In the 2024 –25 Budget, the Government will provide additional 
support to recipients of Paid Parental leave through the 2024 –25 Budget measure 
Commonwealth Government -Funded  Paid Parental Leave  – enhancement , which will provide a 
superannuation guarantee equivalent payment to recipients ’ superannuation fund, for 
births and adoptions on or after 1 July 2025 . 
Assistance to families with children  expenses are expected to  further increase as a result of  
the Child Care Subsidy, primarily reflecting the 2022 –23 October Budget measure Plan for 
Cheaper Child Care .

Expenses for assistance to the unemployed and the sick  are estimated to increase over  the 
period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28, primarily  driven by growth in the expected number of benefits 
recipients, as a result of the unemployment rate expecting to modestly rise from its close to 
historic low, and an increase in the share of recipients receiving full payment.  
Other welfare programs  expen ses are expected to decrease over the period 2024 –25 to 
2027 –28 as a result of terminating measures. Funding for terminating measures will be 
considered in future economic updates. This decrease is partially offset by an increase in 
funding through the 202 4–25 Budget measure The Leaving Violence Program  – financial 
support for victim -survivors of intimate partner violence , which will provide $925.2  million over 
five years from 2023 –24. 
In the 2024 –25 Budget, the Government is investing in measures which will drive progress 
under the National Agreement on Closing the Gap  and deliver better outcomes for First 
Nations people. Expenses for assistance to Indigenous Australians not elsewhere 
classified (nec ) includes  investments in a range of measures to deliver outcomes across 
portfolios addressing the Priority Reforms and Socioeconomic Targets under the National 
Agreement on  Closing the Gap . Major investments through the Northern Territory Homelands 
and Ho using and Remote Jobs and Economic Development Program  deliver the Government ’s 
commitment to improve outcomes for First Nations people  in remote Northern Territory 
and remote Australia . 
Housing and community amenities  
The housing and community amenities f unction includes expenses for the Government ’s 
contribution to the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement , other Australian

Expenses for housing and community amenities are expected to decrease  by 43.7 per cent 
over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28, primarily driven by a decrease in expenses  for urban 
and regional development and environment protection . 
Housing  expenses  include the Government ’s contribution  to the new National Agreement on 
Social Housing and Homelessness , the provision of housing for the general  public and people 
with special need s, and DHA  expenses. Housing  expenses are estimated to increase from 
2024 –25 to 2026 –27, before decrea sing from 2026–27 to 2027 –28, primarily driven by 
terminating National Partnership Payments. The  National Partnership Payments include 
short -term support  for enabling infrastructure through the Housing Support Program, the 
finalisation of Homebuilder and the initial distribution of $100  million in 2024 –25 from the 
Housing Australia Future Fund (HAFF) . This distribution is made towards the 
Government ’s commitment to provide $200 million over five  years to support repairs to, 
maintenance of, and improvements to infrastructure in remote First Nations  communities . 
In the 2024 –25 Budget, the Government is invest ing $9.3 billion over five years from  
2024 –25 through the new National Agreement on Social Housing and Homelessness , which will 
support states an d territories to provide social housing and homelessness services. Subject 
to states and territories agreement to the new National Agreement on Social Housing and 
Homelessness , the Government is also provid ing an additional $1  billion in 2023 –24 to states 
and territories to support enabling infrastructure for new housing through the Housing 
Support Program  – Priority Works Stream . 
The Government is provid ing $1.5 billion over five years from 2023 –24 in grants and 
availability payments to suppor t the supply of social and affordable housing funded 
through : distributions from HAFF ; changes to the National Housing Infrastructure Facility 
to support crisis and transitional accommodation for women  and children fleeing domestic 
violence and youth ; and commitments under the National Housing Accord.  
In addition, the Government will support up to $4.7  billion in concessional loans and 
increase access to guaranteed financing through the Australian Housing Bond Aggregator,  
as part of the  2024 –25 Budget measu re Housing Support . This  measure will  provide eligible  
community housing projects with lower than market rate loans to support the delivery of 
social and affordable housing including those being funded through the HAFF and the 
National Housing Accord. Thes e payments will flow through Housing Australia .

Expenses for  urban and regional development  comprise urban development, services to 
territories, and regional development programs. Expenses under this sub-function are 
estimated to decrease  over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28, primarily reflecting the profile of 
funding for the Priority Community Infrastructure Program and Investing in Our 
Communities Program and the conclusion  of the Community Development Grants 
program and  Building Better R egions Fund.  
Environment protection  expenses  includes expenses for a variety of initiatives, including 
the protection and conservation of the environment, water and waste management, 
pollution abatement and environmental research. Expenses are estimated to  decrease over 
the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28, primarily due to the deferral of construction for the Paradise 
Dam project until beyond 2027 –28 and planned termination of the Critical Inputs to Clean 
Energy Industries program from 2026 –27. The Government ’s investment in clean energy is 
also captured in the fuel and energy function . 
In the 2024 –25 Budget, the Government is provid ing $364.5  million over six years from 
2024 –25 to continue implementation of environmental reforms, streamline environmental 
approvals and deliver the Government ’s circular economy functions  through the measure s 
Nature Positive Plan  – additional funding, Future Made in Australia  – Strengthening  Approvals 
Processes  and Commonwealth Leadership for a Safe Circular Economy – continu ing delivery . The 
Government  is also invest ing in water infrastructure projects under the  
2024 –25 Budget measure  National Water Grid Fund  – responsible investment in water 
infrastructure for the regions .

Total expenses under the recreation and culture function are estimated to increase by 
4.3 per cent over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28. This increase is primarily driven by an 
expected increase  in sport and recreation  expenses , which is linked to the Government ’s 
investment in  venue  infrastructure for the 2032 Brisbane Olympic and Paralympic Games 
provided in the 2023 –24 Budget . The increase is partially offset by a decrease in arts and 
cultural heritage  expenses . The remaining sub -functions are estimated to remain broadly 
stable over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28. 
Broadcasting  expenses reflect the five year funding terms for the Australian Broadcasting 
Corporation and Special Broadcasting Services Corporation that commenced from  
1 July 2023.  
Table  6.11.1 sets out the major components of the broadcasting  sub-function.

Expenses under arts and cultural heritage  are estimated to increase from 2023 –24 to  
2024 –25, followed by a decrease over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28. This is due to 
increased estimated payments under the Australian Screen Production Incentives and 
Digital Game Production Offset programs in 202 3–24 and 2024 –25 and a reduction in 
funding for the Location Incentive Program over the five years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28. 
The decrease is partially offset by additional funding for the national arts training 
organisations and the Australian Film Televisi on and Radio School through the  
2024 –25 Budget measure Revive – National Cultural Policy . This measure  will provide 
$216.6  million over four years to support Australia ’s arts, entertainment, and cultural 
sector.  
Sport and recreation  expenses are estimated to increase over the period 2024 –25 to  
2027 –28, due to  the Government ’s investment in venue infrastructure for the 2032 Brisbane 
Olympic and Paralympic Games . The Government is also providing additional funding 
through the 2024 –25 Budget measures Supporting Sports Participation and Sport Integrity 
Australia – funding support  to continue Commonwealth sport participation and  
high -performance  grants funding programs, provide additional funding to support 
preparation for and delivery of key in ternational events, safeguard the integrity of 
Australian sport and invest in the upgrade and restoration of sporting infrastructure.

National estate and parks  expenses are estimated to decrease slightly over the period 
2024 –25 to 2027 –28, reflecting  the Government ’s upfront investment in 2024 –25 for 
Antarctic  shipping requirements, the Macquarie Island Research Station and cultural 
heritage reform through the 2024 –25 Budget measures, Australian Antarctic 
Program  – additional funding  and Future Made in Australia  – Strengthening A pprovals Processes.

Total fuel and energy expenses are estimated to incre ase in 2024 –25, before  returning to a 
stable trend . The increase in 2024 –25 is driven by the concessional component of the 
Government ’s concessional loan investments to grow Australia ’s renewable energy sector 
through the Rewiring the Nation Fund , administered by the Clean Energy Finance 
Corporation.

The major program within this function is the Fuel Tax Credits Scheme , for which 
payments are  expected to increase over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28, partially offsetting 
the over all function movement. This largely reflects an expected increase in the use of fuels 
that are eligible for the Fuel Tax Credit Scheme.

Statement 6: Expenses and Ne t Capital Investment   |  Page 217 
Resources and Energy  expenses are expected to  fluctuate  over the  period 2024 –25 to  
2027 –28, reflecting the profile of the 2024 –25 Budget measure  Energy  Bill Relief 
Fund  – extension and expansion . This measure is expected to increase expenses from 2023 –24 
to 2024 –25, reflecting the Government ’s focus on providing immediate cost -of-living relief, 
before terminating 2025 –26, resulting in a decrease in expenses from 2025 –26 to 2027 –28. 
Expenses for the Renewable Energy  component are expected to increase for 2024 –25, 
before decreasing for the period 2025 –26 to 2027 –28, reflecting the profile of expenses for 
the concessional component of the concessional loan deployment by the Clean Energy 
Finance Corporation. The forecasted loan deployment is primarily expected to be made 
under the 2022 –23 October Budget measure  Powering Australia  – Rewiring the Nation . In th e 
2024 –25 Budget, the Government is continuing to invest in renewable energy and clean 
energy technologies, including through an additional round of Hydrogen Headstart, the 
commencement of the Hydrogen Production Tax Incentive from 2027 –28 and the Solar Sunshot  
program.  
Agriculture, forestry and fishing  
The agriculture, forestry and fishing function include expenses to support assistance to 
primary producers , forestry, fishing, land and water resources management , biosecurity

scheduled completion of activities under the Murray -Darling Basin Plan 2012 (Basin Plan) , 
within natural resources development . 
The overall decrease in the agriculture, forestry and fishing function is partially offset by an 
increase in expenses  for rural assistance . This is largely due to an expected increase in Farm 
Household Allowance payments from 2024 –25, due to  the start of the new ten year claim  
period for eligible recipients on 1  July 2024.

Expenses for the Research and Development Tax Incentive  administered by the 
Australian Taxation Office are expected to increase over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28 due 
to increases in the number and value of expected claims from eligible compani es, 
particularly  companies in the ‘Professional, Scientific and Technical Services ’ industry . 
The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility  offers debt and equity finance to projects 
that contribute to the establishment or enhancement of economic activity in northern 
Australia. Expenses are expected to increase over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28, due to 
changes in concessional loan discount e xpenses associated with the expected commitment 
of concessional loans across the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28. 
Expenses under the Other component are expected to increase over the period 202 4–25 to 
2027–28, driven by the 2024 –25 Budget measures  Future Made in  Australia  – Making Australia 
a Renewable Energy Superpower  and Future Made in Australia  – Investing in Innovation , Science 
and Digital Capabilities . This measure will provide additional resourcing to Geoscience 
Australia  to map all of Australia’s critical minerals, strategic minerals, groundwater, and 
other resources essential to the transition to net zero . This funding also covers the expenses 
involved in introduc ing the Critical Minerals Production Tax Incentive. The expected 
increase  in expenses will be partially offset by the Growing Business Investment 
component which is expected to decrease in expenses over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28, 
reflecting terminating measures.  
Transport and communication  
The transport and communication function includes expenses to support the infrastructure 
and regulatory framework for Australia ’s transport and communication sectors.  Expenses 
for the transport and communication function primarily reflect Government investment in 
road and rail transport through the Infrastructure Investment Program . This function also 
includes expenditure for communications activities and support for the digital economy 
through the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, 
Communications and the Arts, and the Australian Communications and Media Authority .

Total expenses under this function are estimated to decrease by 12.6 per cent from 2024 –25 
to 2027 –28. This is largely  driven by the realignment of project profiles under the 
Infrastructure Investment Program to more accurately  reflect delivery schedules , as well as 
the completion of priority infrastructure projects .

Page 220  |  Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  
Communication  expenses are estimated to decrease from 2 024–25 to 2027 –28, primarily 
reflecting the funding profile for the Better Connectivity Plan for Regional and Rural 
Australia, and the conclusion of the  Mobile Black Spot Program.  
Rail transport  expenses are estimated to increase from 2023 –24 to 2024 –25, before  
decreas ing from 2024 –25 to 2027 –28. The initial increase and subsequent decrease in 
expenditure  reflects the schedules of major rail infrastructure projects, including projects 
under the METRONET program and Sydney Metro – Western Sydney Airport . 
Air transport  expenses primarily relate to activities of the safety regulator Civil Aviation 
Safety Authority , and aviation related initiatives. Total expenses  are estimated to  decrease 
from 202 4–25 to 2027 –28, due to the conclusion of a number of aviati on initiatives, 
including upgrades at Hobart and Newcastle Airports and the timing of additional rounds 
of regional aviation connectivity programs provided through the 2024 –25 Budget measure 
Supporting Transport Priorities . 
Road transport  expenses are estimated to increase from 2023 –24 to 202 5–26, and then 
decrease from 202 5–26 to 2027 –28. The increase and subsequent decrease  in expenditure, 
reflects the Government ’s continued investment in priority road infrastructure projects, and 
the exp ected completion of priority infrastructure projects including t he Bunbury Outer 
Ring Road and M12 Motorway. Thro ugh the 2024 –25 Budget measure Building a Better 
Future Through Considered Infrastructure Investment , the Government is provid ing 
$16.5  billion  towards priority road and rail projects and re -profile $2.1 billion to beyond the  
forward estimates to better align with construction market conditions and project delivery 
timeframes.  
Total expenses  for other transport and communication are estimated to decrease from 
2024 –25 to 2027 –28, primarily reflecting the timeline of departmental  activities under  the 
2024 –25 Budget measure New Vehicle Efficiency Standard Implementation .

Total  expenses for other  economic affairs are estimated to decrease by 14.0 per cent over the 
period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28, reflecting the cessation of the Boosting Apprenticeship 
Commencements wage subsidy . The Government is undertaking a Strategic Review of the 
Australian Apprenticeships Incentive System and, through the 2024 –25 Budget measure 
Australian Apprenticeships Incentive System  – further support , is providing additional financial 
support to apprenti ces and their employers while this review is completed.  
The largest movement in the other economic affairs function is estimated to occur in 
vocational and industry training , with other significant movements in expenses in labour 
market assistance to job s eekers and industry, immigration , and other economic affairs 
nec. The remaining sub -functions are estimated to remain broadly stable over the period 
2024 –25 to 2027 –28. 
Vocational and industry training  expenses are estimated to decrease over the period  
2024 –25 to 2027 –28, primarily reflecting the cessation of the temporary COVID -19 support  
Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements wage subsidy, which is closed to new 
applicants . The Government is providing additional support to apprentices and their 
employer s through the 2024 –25 Budget measure Australian Apprenticeships Incentive System  
– further support , while the Government undertakes the Strategic Review of the Australian 
Apprenticeships Inventive System . This support , targeted towards apprenticeships in 
priority occupations, will boost apprenticeship commencements in industries where skills 
needs are greatest . 
Labour market assistance to job seekers and industry  expenses  are estimated to increase 
over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28, reflecting the Governmen t’s commitment to strengthen 
Australia ’s employment services system and improve outcomes for individuals accessing 
employment services more broadly. The growth in expenses is primarily driven by 
implementing a range of improvements to the current employment services system, 
consistent with the Government ’s vision for a dynamic and inclusive labour market  and the 
Employment White Paper.

Industrial relations  expenses are estimated to decrease  over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28 
largely as a result of terminating funding provided in the 2023 –24 MYEFO measures 
Prohibition on the Use of Engineered Stone – communication strategy  and Review of the Safety, 
Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 . This decrease is expected to be  partially offset by a 
range of supports to progress the Government ’s workplace relations agenda, critical to the 
implementation of changes made by the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) 
Act 2023 , and further reforms passed in the Fair Work Legislation Amendmen t (Closing 
Loopholes No.2) Bill 2023 . 
The immigration  sub-function includes the provision of migration and citizenship services, 
the management of unlawful non -citizens , and refugee and humanitarian assistance. 
Immigration  expenses are expected to decrease  over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28, 
primarily reflecting the forecast reduction of the detainee population in onshore detention 
and in the offshore processing centre .

to 202 7–28. This reflects a decrease in departmental expenses for the Department of 
Industry, Science, and Resources and the Australian Securities and Investments 
Commission.  
The decrease in departmental expenses for the Department of Industry, Science, and 
Resources over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28, is driven by a range of terminating measures 
and the provision of terminating departmental funding in elements of the  2024 –25 Budget 
measure  Future Made in Australia  – Investing in Innovation, Science and Digital Capabilities  
which provides funding to the National Measurement Institute to ensure sophisticated and 
reliable Australian measurement capability to underpin the Governmen t’s Future Made in 
Australia  agenda.  
Expenses for other economic affairs nec  also include s funding for the Australian 
Competition and Consumer Commission provided through the 2024 –25 Budget measure  
Competition Reform . This measure will provide funding to implement a mandatory and 
suspensory administrative merger control system to prevent harmful mergers, maintain 
competition, and increase transparency.

Other purposes  
The other purposes function includes expenses incurred in the servicing of public debt 
interest, and assistance to state, territory and local governments. This function also includes 
items classified as natural disaster relief, the Contingency Reserve , and expenses related to 
the nominal interest on u nfunded liabilities for government superannuation  benefits.

Page 224  |  Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  
Total expenses for other purposes are estimated to increase by 39.0 per cent over the period 
2024–25 to 202 7–28. 
The main drivers of the increase in other purposes  expenses are public debt interest, 
general purpose inter -government transactions , and the contingency reserve . 
Public debt interest  expenses  are expected to increase from 2023 –24, largely reflecting 
higher debt servicing costs.  
The increase in nominal superannuation interest  expen ses between 2023 –24 and 2024 –25 
primarily reflects the use of updated discount rates. In accordance with accounting 
standards, superannuation expenses for 202 3–24 are calculated using the long -term 
government bond rate  that best matched each individual sch eme’s duration of liabilities at 
the start of the financial year. These rates were between  4.0 and 4.4 per cent per  year . In 
preparing the latest Long Term Cost Reports, the scheme actuaries have determined that a 
discount rate of 5.0 per cent should be applied to the estimates in the budget year and 
forward estimates as per usual practice.  
General purpose inter -government t ransactions  expenses are made up of general revenue 
assistance paid to state and territory governments and local government assistance. 
Expenses are expected to increase over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28. Nearly all the 
expenses relate to general revenue assistance paid to state and territory governments, 
which is expected to increase over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28, largely comprising 
payments of GST entitlements provided on an ‘untied ’ basis. Payments to state and 
territory governments tied to specifi c purposes are reported under the relevant sections in 
this Statement. Further information on general revenue assistance to the states and 
territories can be found in Budget Paper No. 3, Federal Financial Relations . 
Expenses for  natural disaster relief  reflect financial support provided by the Australian 
Government to affected states and territories under the Natural Disaster Relief and 
Recovery Arrangements  and, since November 2018, the Disaster Recovery Funding 
Arrangements . Expenses  also reflect departmental funding for the National Emergency 
Management Agency. The majority of funding over the period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28 reflects 
expected payments to the states in relation to disaster events that have already occurred. As 
provisions ar e not generally made for future disasters, the amount reduces over time. 
Additional funding is provisioned as needed in response to natural disasters.  
   
Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 6: Expenses and Ne t Capital Investment   |  Page 225 
The contingency reserve  in the 2024 –25 Budget is estimated to increase expenses by 
$166.6  million in 20 24–25, $14.7 billion in 2025 –26, $19.4 billion in 2026 –27 and $26.5 billion 
in 2027 –28. A key component of this is the conservative bias allowance, which makes 
provision for the tendency for the estimate of expenses for existing Government policy 
(excludin g GST payments to the states) to be revised upwards in the forward years. The 
2024 –25 Budget includes a provision of:  
• nil in the Budget year 2024 –25 
• ½ of a percentage point of total general government sector expenses in the first forward 
year 2025 –26 ($3.3  billion)  
• 1 per cent of general government sector  expenses in the second forward year 2026 –27 
($6.8 billion)  
• 2 per cent of general government sector  expenses in the third forward year 2027 –28 
($14.1 billion).  
The drawdown of the conservative bias allowance  decreased expenses by $1.6 billion in 
2024 –25, $1.5 billion in 2025 –26, $3.2 billion in 2026 –27 and $3.1 billion in 2027 –28. This is 
consistent with long standing practice and does not represent a saving or offset to spending 
measures.  
As part of  the Government ’s responsible approach to economic management, the 
Contingency Reserve includes a provision for the estimated financial impact of further 
wage increases resulting from the decision of the Fair Work Commission ’s Aged Care 
Work Value Case  – Stage 3, with the operative date and phasing in of wage increases still to 
be determined. The Government has also made a provision to deliver on its commitment to 
provide funding towards a wage increase for Early Childhood Education and Care 
workers, wi th details to be finalised following Fair Work Commission processes.  
The Contingency Reserve also includes a provision to reflect the outcomes of the 
December  2023 National Cabinet meeting and to meet future anticipated disaster recovery 
costs . 
The Conting ency Reserve also includes estimates for policy decisions that have been 
announced but cannot yet be included in entity estimates, usually due to some uncertainty  
as to their final cost and/or outcomes, or as they are subject to negotiations . 
   
  |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 226  |  Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  
In general,  the Contingency Reserve can include:  
• commercial -in-confidence and national security -in-confidence items that cannot be 
disclosed separately  
• financial assistance to state and territory governments for future programs and reforms 
subject to negotiations, in cluding commitments made by National Cabinet  
• the effect, on the budget and forward estimates, of economic parameter revisions 
received late in the process and hence not able to be allocated to individual entities or 
functions  
• decisions taken but not yet an nounced by the Government, and decisions made too late 
for inclusion against individual entity estimates  
• provisions for other specific events and pressures that are reasonably expected to affect 
the budget estimates, including the continuation of terminati ng measures.

Statement 6: Expenses and Ne t Capital Investment   |  Page 227 
General government net capital investment  
Net capital investment is broadly defined as the sale and acquisition of non -financial assets, 
less depreciation expenses. It provides a measure of the overall growth in capital assets 
(including bui ldings and infrastructure, specialist military equipment, and computer 
software) after taking into account depreciation and amortisation as previously acquired 
assets age.  
Government capital spending involves acquisition of physical assets, financial asset s and 
provision of grants and subsidies to others (primarily state and territory governments), 
which they then use to acquire assets.  
Australian Government general government sector net capital investment is expected to be 
$6.3 billion in 2024 –25, reflecting a decrease from 2023 –24. Net capital investment is 
expected to increase to $1 1.9 billion in 2027 –28, primarily reflecting capability investments 
prioritised in the 2024  National Defence Strategy and Integrated Investment Pro gram . 
Details of movements are further explained in the following section.

Estimated net capital investment for 2024 –25 is $0.9 billion lower when compared to the 
estimate for 2024 –25 in the 2023 –24 Budget.  This  is driven by a decrease of $2.7 billion  as a 
result of parameter and other variations and an increase of $1.8  billion from policy 
decisions.

Total net capital investment  7,754  6,303  8,055  8,988  11,899  
A significant component of the Government ’s net capital investment occurs in the defence 
function and primarily relates to Defence capability investments . Major factors contributing 
to changes in net capital investment  are expected to occur in the following functions : 
• Defence  – the increase in net  capital investment from 2024 –25 to 2027 –28 reflects 
funding for capability investments prioritised in the 2024 National Defence Strategy and 
Integrated Investment Program . 
• General public services  – the increase  in net capital investment from 2024 –25 to  
2027 –28 largely reflects the timing of  estimated renewal of property leases that are due 
to expire  and the timing of building and equipment purchases.  
• Health  – net capital investment is estimated to increase in 2 024–25 and 2025 –26, largely 
reflecting funding for system enhancements to the My Aged Care Gateway system and 
the Government Provider Management System  to support  the implementation of the 
new Aged  Care  Act, the new  aged care  regulatory model and the Support at Home 
Program  from 1  July 2025 . The increase in 2024 –25 and 2025 –26 is also driven by routine 
replenishment of the National Medical Stockpile.  
• Social security and welfare  – the decrease in net capital investment from 202 4–25 to 
2027 –28 is largely driven by the depreciation and amortisation of prior Commonwealth 
investments into Services Australia ’s assets , including  ICT capabilities and 
infrastructure .  
  |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 230  |  Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  
• Housing and community amenities  – the increase  in net capital investment over the 
period 2024 –25 to 2027 –28 largely reflects changes in Defence Housing Australia ’s 
property investment strategy to meet the housing needs of Australian Defence Force 
personnel . 
• Recreation and culture  – the decrease in net ca pital investment from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28 
reflects the expected completion of capital investments at the Australian War Memorial 
and projects within various Commonwealth national parks funded under the Protecting 
Australia ’s Iconic National Parks measure. T he decrease is also driven by anticipated 
completion of projects under the 2023 –24 Budget measure Sydney Harbour Federation 
Trust – infrastructure improvements  and completion of the various projects led by the 
Australian Antarctic Division and the Director  of National Parks, delays in the 
refurbishment of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority ’s Reef HQ Aquarium , 
and the timing of  capital works at the National Collecting Institutions . 
• Transport and communication  – the variable profile of net capital i nvestment reflects 
the sale of non -financial assets through the 850/900 MHz and the 3.4/3.7 GHz Spectrum  
Auctions.  
• Other economic affairs  – the decrease in net capital investment from 2023 –24 to 2024 –25 
reflect s the anticipated completion of the Bureau of Meteorology ’s digital 
transformation program .

Statement 7: Debt Statement   |  Page 235 Statement 7:  
Debt Statement  
The Debt Statement provides information on Government gross debt, net debt, Australian 
Government Securities (AGS) issuance and interest costs over the forward estimates.  
Gross debt as a share of GDP is expected to be lower each year over the forward esti mates 
compared to the 2023–24 Mid-Year  Economic and Fiscal Outlook  (MYEFO ). Gross debt is 
estimated to peak at 35.2 per cent of  GDP at 30 June  2027 , 0.2 percentage  points lower  and 
one year sooner than the estimated peak  of 35.4 per cent of GDP in 2027–28 at the 
2023 -24 MYEFO.   
• Gross debt is estimated to be 33.9 per cent of GDP at  30 June  2025, 0.3 percentage  points 
lower than estimated at the 2023–24 MYEFO .  
• Net debt is estimated to be 20.0 per cent of GDP at  30 June  2025 , 0.5 percentage  points 
higher than estimated at the 2023–24 MYEFO .  
Interest payments on AGS are estimated to be $ 22.4 billion in 202 4–25, increasing to 
$34.1 billion by 202 7–28.

Statement 7: Debt Statement   |  Page 239 Statement 7: Debt Statement  
Australian Government Securities on issue  
Estimates of AGS on issue are published in both face value and market value terms in 
this Statement.  
• The face value  of AGS on issue (also referred to as gross debt) is the amount the 
Government pays back to investors at matur ity, independent of fluctuations in market 
prices.36 The total face value of AGS on issue changes when new securities are issued, or 
when securities are repurchased or reach maturity.  
• The market value  of AGS on issue represents the value of securities as t raded on the 
secondary market, which changes continuously with movements in market prices (often 
quoted as a yield to maturity). Consistent with external reporting standards, the market 
value of AGS on issue is reported in the Australian Government general  government 
sector balance sheet.  
The Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911  (CIS Act) requires the Treasurer to issue a 
direction stipulating the maximum face value of relevant AGS that may be on issue. 
Effective  from 7 October 2020, the then Treasurer directed that the maximum face value of 
AGS that can be on issue is $1,200  billion . The estimated face value of AGS on issue subject 
to the Treasurer ’s direction (end -of-year and within -year peak)37 in each year of the 
forward estimates remains below $1,200  billion .  
Gross debt is estimated to be $ 934 billion ( 33.9 per cent of GDP) at  30 June  2025, increasing 
to $1,112  billion ( 34.9 per cent of GDP ) at 30 June 202 8.  
Gross debt  as a percentage of GDP  is expected to b e lower across each year of the forward 
estimates than at the 2023–24 MYEFO . The $ 13.1 billion improvement to the headline  cash 
balance in 2023–24 and the impact of lower yields on AGS  contribute to this  reduction .  
  
— 
36  For Treasury Indexed Bonds (TIBs), the final repayment amount paid to investors includes 
an additional amount to reflect the impact of inflation over the life of the security. 
This  additional amount is not in cluded in the calculation of face value.  
37  End-of-year values are estimates of AGS on issue at 30  June for the particular year. 
The precise timing and level of within -year peaks of AGS on issue cannot be determined 
with accuracy. The timing of the within -year peak is therefore reported to the given month in 
the particular year.    |  Budget Paper No. 1

equivalent market value of AGS that are subject to the Treasurer ’s Direction.  
b) The stock and securities that are excluded from the current limit set by the Treasurer ’s Direction are 
outlined in subsection 51JA(2A) of the CIS Act.  
c) The precise within -year timing of cash receipts and payments is not known. Estimated peaks of AGS on 
issue are therefore subject to considerable uncertainty.

Changes in AGS on issue since the 2023–24 MYEFO  
The increase  in total face value of AGS on issue primarily reflects the cumulative  reduction  
in the headline cash balance over the four years to 2026 –27 since the 2023–24 MYEFO . 
Table  3.4 in Statement  3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  reconciles the net cash  flows f rom 
investments in financial assets for policy purposes affecting  the headline cash balance.

Green Treasury Bonds  
The Government will begin issuing Green Treasury Bonds b efore  30 June 2024. The initial 
bond line will be around $7  billion in size and will mature in June 2034.  Issuance of green 
bonds will not impact gross debt estimates as it will replace issuance of other  AGS.  
Green bonds  provide financing or refinancing for specific government programs with 
positive climate change and environmental outcomes. Green bonds will e nable investors to 
back public projects that drive Australia ’s net zero transformation and progress the 
Government ’s environment al agenda. Green bonds will boost the scale and credibility of 
Australia ’s green finance market and attract more green capital to Australia by increasing 
transparency around climate outcomes and the availability of green investments.  
The Government will publi sh annual Allocation and Impact Report s for green b onds 
separate to t he Budget, commencing no more than 18 months after the first issuance . 
Non-resident holdings of AGS on issue  
As at the  December 2023  quarter, the proportion of non -resident holdings of AGS was 
around 48 per cent (Chart 7.1). This proportion is down from hi storical highs of 
around  76 per cent in 2012. While the value of non -resident holdings of AGS have increased 
significantly over this time, the proportion has fallen since the rate of buying by 
non-resident investors has not matched the rate of issuance.

Net debt  
Net debt is equal to the sum of interest -bearing liabilities (which include AGS on issue 
measured at mar ket value) less the sum of selected financial assets (cash and deposits, 
advances paid and investments, loans and placement s). As net debt incorporates both 
selected financial assets and liabilities at their fair value, it provides a broader measure 
of the Government ’s financial obligations than gross debt.  
Not all government assets or liabilities are included in the measurement of net debt. For  
example, the Government ’s unfunded superannuation liability is not accounted for in net 
debt, nor are holdings of  equities, for example those held by the Future Fund or the 
Government ’s equity investment in the NBN .

Changes in net debt since the 2023–24 MYEFO  
Net debt is expected to be higher  than estimated at the 2023–24 MYEFO  across each year of 
the forward estimates. This increase  primarily reflects  the impact of lower yields on AGS, 
as well as an increase in the financing requirement from 202 4–25 onwards .

Interest on AGS  
Estimates of the interest payments and expense of AGS on issue include the cost of AGS 
already on issue and future AGS issuance.  
• The cost of AGS already on issue reflects the actual yield at the time of issuance.  
• The expected cost of future AGS issuance is based on a recent average of daily spot rates 
across the yield curve at the time of a budget estimates update.  
Total i nterest payments on AGS across the forward estimates are estimated to be broadly 
similar  compared to the 2023–24 MYEFO . This is  primarily due to  lower yields and 
improved terms of borrowing offsetting  the change  in the headline  cash balance across the  
forward estimates .  
Chart  7.2 shows the yield curve assumptions underpinning the 2022  Pre-election Economic 
and Fiscal Outlook  (PEFO) , 2023 -24 MYEFO  and the 202 4–25 Budget. Yields are lower 
compared to the 2023–24 MYEFO , reflecting a moderation in market expectations for 
inflation and future cash rates.   
Volatility in y ields over the past two years has influenced the outlook for  interest 
payments . The supply of bonds, expectations for future monetary policy and perceptions of 
risks all influence yields. While yields have fallen since the end of 2023, they remain 
significantly higher  than at the 2022  PEFO .  
At the 2022  PEFO , the weighted average cost of borrowing was 2.2  per cent, rising to 
3.8 per cent at the 2022 –23 October  Budget . The weighted average y ield fell  to 3.4 per cent 
at the 2023 –24 Budget , before increasing  to 4.7 per cent at the 2023 –24 MYEFO . Since then , 
the assumed weighted average cost of borrowing has fallen to 4.2 per cent for future 
issuance of Treasury Bonds over the forward estimates  in this budget .    |  Budget Paper No. 1

By the end of the forward estimates total interest payments are $35.6 billion , of which 
$34.1 billion relates to AGS on issue (Table  7.9). Compared with  the 2023–24 MYEFO , 
interest payments as a share of GDP are estimated to be broadly unchanged since  the 
2023–24 MYEFO.  
Interest receipts are estimated to be higher across each year of the forward estimates than at 
the 2023–24 MYEFO  and broadly unchanged as a share of GDP .  
Net interest payments as a share of GDP in 2024–25 are estimated to be broadly similar to  
the 2023–24 MYEFO . Over the forward estimates, net interest payments as a share of GDP 
are expected to be 0.5 per cent in 2023–24, reaching  0.8 per cent of GDP by 2 027–28.

• Interest expense is recognised in the period in which an expense is incurred during the 
life of the security, rather than when it is actually pai d.

Appendix A: AGS issuance  
The Australian Office of Financial Management ( AOFM ) is responsible for issui ng AGS and 
managing the Government ’s financing activities. The AOFM currently issues three  types of 
securities:  
• Treasury Bonds:  medium to long -term securities with a fixed annual rate of interest 
payable every six months.  This will include the Green Treasury B onds the Government 
will begin issuing before 30 June 2024.  
• Treasury Indexed Bonds (TIBs):  medium to long -term securities for which the cap ital 
value of the security is adjusted for movements in the consumer price index (CPI). 
Interest on TIBs is paid quarterly, at a fixed rate, on the adjusted capital value.  
• Treasury Notes:  short -term discount securities which mature within one year of 
issua nce. The volume of Treasury Notes on issue will vary over the course of the year, 
depending on the size and profile of the within -year funding requirements.  
Within these three  broad categories of AGS, issuance is undertaken into a limited number 
of maturities (known as lines). The number of lines on issue is determined by the AOFM as 
part of its debt portfolio management role. Each line has a fixed maturity date (the date on 
which the Government repays the principal it has borrowed) and, for Treasury Bonds and 
TIBs, a coupon rate (the annual fixed interest rate paid on the  security).  
Concentrating AGS issuance into a limited number of lines (rather than issuing securities 
with a  specific tenor, such as ten years) ensures each line is sufficiently large that it can be 
more readily traded in the secondary market. Strong liquidity in the secondary market is 
attractive to investors and intermediaries, promotes demand for AGS and assi sts in 
lowering borrowing costs. All AGS issuance is undertaken in Australian dollars.  
The AOFM exercises operational independence in the execution of its duties. Its  announced 
issuance program for each year is determined on the basis of maturing AGS, net new 
issuance required to fund the Budget and operational considerations.   
Operational considerations often mean that the annual issuance program may not be 
equivalent to the financing task for a particular year. For example, the AOFM may decide 
there is me rit in holding higher or lower cash balances. The AOFM may also choose to 
smooth issuance across several financial years in order to reduce changes in AGS issuance 
from one financial year to the next.  
The AOFM aims to maintain an AGS yield curve out to a 3 0-year benchmark bond. 
This  facilitates a lower risk profile of maturing debt, broadens the investor base and helps 
to reduce the impact of interest rate volatility on budget outcomes. Further details on the 
AOFM’s debt issuance program are available on th e AOFM website at www.aofm.gov.au .    |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 252  |  Statement 7: Debt Statement  
The AOFM publishes an issuance program for the budget year only. Estimates beyond the 
budget year are based on a set of technical assumptions and will vary with changes to these 
assumptions and budget estimates .  
 
 
Statement 8: Forecasting Performance and Sensitivity Analysis   |  Page 253  Statement 8:  
Forecasting Performance  
and Sensitivity Analysis  
Economic and fiscal forecasts and projections in the Budget are underpinned by a range of 
assumptions and judgements based on best available information at the time of 
preparation. In practice, economic and fiscal circumstances can evolve in ways that diff er 
from expectations.  
This statement assesses:   
1. The performance of past forecasts based on the variance between forecasts and actuals . 
2. The uncertainty around current forecasts using confidence interval analysis .  
3. The sensitivity of current forecasts to ch anges in key assumptions:   
– Iron ore prices  
– Yields on Australian Government Securities .  
The economic impact of other key variables, including  iron ore and metallurgical coal  
prices  are considered in Budget  Statement  2: Economic  Outlook . The fiscal impact of key 
developments and Australia ’s climate change outlook are considered in Budget Statement  3: 
Fiscal  Strategy  and Outlook.  
Forecasts are based on assumptions and judgements. Forecast accuracy depends on 
whether assumptions and judgements prove to be correct, and the reliability of the 
modelled economic and fiscal relationships.

Assessing past forecasting performance  
This section assesses the variance between historical forecasts and outcomes (forecast 
errors) for real and nominal GDP, tax receipts, non -tax receipts, payments and the 
underlying cash balance.  
Forecasts are prepared using a range  of techniques:   
• Macroeconomic forecasts are prepared consistent with a national accounting framework 
using econometric models, analysis and professional judgement.  
• Tax receipts forecasts are generally prepared using a ‘base plus growth ’ methodology. 
The l ast outcome for each head of revenue is the base to which growth rates are applied, 
using appropriate economic parameters. Forecasts are then updated to include costings 
of new policy.  
• Payments forecasts are generally prepared through analysis of payment p rogram data, 
costings for new policies and historical trends in programs, in consultation with 
relevant agencies.

Economic forecasting performance  
Real GDP forecasts incorporate assumptions for exchange rates, interest rates, commodity 
prices and population growth. The forecasts also incorporate judgements about how 
domestic and international developments might  affect Australia ’s economy.  
Real GDP gr ew by 3.1 per cent in  2022–23 rather than the 3½ per cent growth forecast at the 
March  2022–23 Budget (Chart  8.1). The overestimate of real GDP growth in  2022 –23 was 
primarily due to weaker -than -expected household consumption in response to cost-of-
living pressures .

Nominal GDP forecasts include a price component that adds uncertainty  compared to real 
GDP forecasts. Price uncertainty relates to domestic prices and wages, prices of imported 
goods, and world prices for Australia ’s exports including commodities. Since the 
early  2000s, nominal GDP forecast errors have largely reflected vol atility in global 
commodity prices.  
Nominal GDP grew by 9.9 per cent in  2022–23 rather than the ½ per cent growth forecast at 
the March  2022–23 Budget (Chart  8.2). The large underestimat ion in nominal GDP largely  
reflected higher -than -expected  commodity prices . The March  2022 –23 Budget assumed  
commodity prices  would  decrease  to levels  more  consistent with long -term fundamentals , 
but global energy prices and the prices of Australian coal and LNG exports  remained 
elevated , partly due to the continuation of Russ ia’s invasion  of Ukraine . Cons equen tly, over 
2022 –23, the terms of trade  decreased by 0.5 per cent, rather than the decline of 
21¼ per cent expected in the March  2022 –23 Budget .

Fiscal forecasting performance  
Fiscal forecast errors are driven by economic and demographic forecast errors, along with 
unanticipated changes in demand for government programs.  Government policies 
announced after the Budget can also affect fiscal forecast errors. Further information on 
Budget outcomes can be found in the 2022–23 Final  Budget  Outcome.  
Total receipts  
Total receipts are comprised of tax and non -tax receipts (for example, dividends from 
investment funds). Tax receipts account for over 90 .0 per cent of total receipts and are 
therefore the main driver of forecasting performance.  
Total receipts grew 11.1 per cent in  2022–23 rather than the  1.6 per cent decrease  forecast at 
the March  2022–23 Budget. Total receipts were $ 101.8  billion higher than forecast.  
Tax receipts  
Tax receipts grew 12.1 per cent in  2022–23 rather than the 0.8 per cent decrease  forecast at 
the March  2022–23 Budget (Chart  8.3). Tax rec eipts were $ 92.9 billion higher than forecast.  
This outcome reflected  higher -than -expected company tax receipts and 
stronger -than -expected employment and wage growth.

On average, nominal GDP forecast errors magnif y tax receipts forecast errors, owing to

Non-tax receipts  
Forecast variances for non -tax receipts are generally driven by financial  market volatility 
which impact s investment earnings and resource royalties.  
Non -tax receipts grew by 0. 8 per cent in  2022–23 rather than the 11.1 per cent decrease 
forecast at the March  2022 –23 Budget (Chart  8.5). Non -tax receipts were $8.9 billion highe r 
in 2022 –23 than forecast in the  March  2022 –23 Budget. This increase largely reflects 
significant variations in returns on investments, including higher than estimated earnings 
from interest on cash deposits due to the rise in short -term interest rates, and higher th an 
estimated earnings from the Future Fund and the Australian Government Investment 
Funds. Additionally, increases to non -tax receipts flowed from increased passport demand 
following the reopening of Australia ’s borders, and higher -than -estimated receipts under 
the Higher Education Loan Program due to strong labour market conditions.

Payments  
Payments forecasting performance is affected by growth in indexation factors (for example, 
CPI growth) and demand for government programs. Demand -driven programs, such as 
payments to individuals for social welfare, form the bulk of Australian Government  
expenditure and vary wi th economic conditions.  
Payments increased by 1.8 per cent in  2022 –23 rather than the 1.7 per cent decrease forecast 
at the March  2022 –23 Budget (Chart  8.6). Payments were $ 1.8 billion higher  in 2022 –23 than  
forecast in the  March  2022 –23 Budget. This relatively small increase reflects a large number 
of individual variations having offsetting impacts. These include higher -than -estimated 
payments across a range of welfare programs, including Jobseeker, the Disability Support 
Pension, and the Age Pen sion due to higher -than -expected indexation. Policy decisions

Page 262  |  Statement 8: Forecasting Performance and Sensitivity Analysis  
made in the 2022 –23 October  Budget to deliver cheaper child care , ease the cost of living for 
families, and reduce barriers to greater workforce participation also resulted in increases to 
payments in 2022 –23. These increases were partially offset by lower -than -expected  interest  
payments due to the reduction in the level of gross debt . The stronger budget position 
resulted from a range of factors, including upgrades to tax revenue that were lar gely used 
to repair the budget , and lower -than -estimated medical benefits payments, resulting from 
lower spending on COVID -19 pathology and vaccine administration and a reduction in 
demand for services.

Underlying cash balance  
Underlying cash balance forecasting performance is driven by the forecast errors of total 
receipts and payments.  
The underlying cash surplus  was 0.9 per cent of GDP in  2022 –23 rather than the forecast 
deficit  of 3.4 per cent of GDP (Chart  8.7). The underlying cash balance  was $ 100.0  billion 
more than forecast. The better -than -expected underlying cash balance outcome in  2022 –23 
largely reflected higher -than -expected  receipts , the majority of which were returned to the 
budget .

The underlying cash balance38 forecast error  for 2022 –23 is consist ent with the experience of 
the past two decades, outside major downturns, where forecast errors  largely reflect 
forecast errors of total receipts (Chart  8.8). In 2022 –23 key contribut ors to the error were the 
impact on tax receipts of higher  global commodi ty prices and stronger -than -expected 
employment and wage growth .  
Large forecast errors for payments in  2008 –09 and  2019 –20 reflected unexpected 
Government payment assistance during the Global Financial Crisis and COVID –19. 
Overestimates of receipts tend to coincide with underestimates of payments during 
economic shocks,  magnifying underlying cash balance forecast errors.  
— 
38  Between  2005 –06 and  2019 –20, the underlying cash balance was equal to receipts less 
payments, less net Future Fund earnings. In all other years, the underlying cash balance is 
equal to receipts less payments.

Assessing forecast uncertainty – confidence interval analysis  
Confidence intervals illustrate the uncertainty around current forecasts based on the 
historical distribution of forecast errors. Confidence interval analysis assumes that future 
forecast errors are consistent with the distribution of past forecast errors39 Based on past 
forecasting performance, there is a  70 and 90  per cent probability that the actual outcome  
will lie within the  70 and  90 per cent confidence interval bands.  
Future forecast errors may not have the same distribution as historical forecast er rors. The 
large forecast errors in 2019 –20 and 2020 –21, related to the COVID –19 pandemic , are an 
example of events not previously captured in the historical error sample. Large disruptive 
events are difficult to predict and could occur again in the future.   
Economic uncertainty based on historical forecast errors  
Average annualised growth in real GDP in the three  years to  2025–26 is expected to be 
around 2 per cent. The 70  per cent confidence interval ranges from 1¼ per cent to 
2¾ per cent. The 90  per cent confidence interval ranges from 1 per cent to 3 per cent 
(Chart  8.9).

The confidence intervals around the nominal GDP forecasts are wider than those around 
the real GDP forecasts, reflecting the additional uncertainty around dom estic prices and 
commodity prices. Average annualised growth in nominal GDP in the three  years

ranging from 1½ per cent to 6 per cent. The 90  per cent confidence int erval ranges from

Fiscal uncertainty based on historical forecast errors  
Fiscal estimates are  based on economic and demographic forecasts as well as estimates of 
spending and revenue measures.  
Historical variations caused by subsequent policy decisions not known at the time of

available information at the time  of preparation . Payment estimates do not exclude  the 
public debt interest associated with these subsequent policy decisions because this cannot

Statement 8: Forecasti ng Performance and Sensitivity Analysis   |  Page 271 
Assessing current forecasts through sensitivity analysis  
Sensitivity analysis allows for an assessment of the impact  of key assumptions. The 
following sensitivity analyses are considered due to their variability and importan ce for the 
Budget:   
• Higher and lower iron ore prices.  
• Higher and lower yields over the medium term.  
For illustrative purposes, the upper and lower sensitivities are broadly symmetric, even 
where not equally probable.   
Movements in iron ore prices  
The forec asts for nominal GDP and tax receipts are sensitive to commodity price 
assumptions, particularly iron ore prices. Iron ore is Australia ’s largest export by value, 
representing around 18.0 per cent of the total value of goods and services  exports in  2022 –
23. See Budget  Statement  2: Economic  Outlook  for more information on developments in 
commodity prices.  
Iron ore prices are volatile and sensitive to global market developments. Table  8.1 considers 
the impact of a permanent US$10  per tonne increase and decrease in the iron ore price on 
nominal GDP and tax receipts relative to the Budget baseline  forecast .

The effects of a US$10  per tonne increase and decrease in the iron ore price are broadly 
symmetric.  The following discussion focuses mainly on an increase for illustrative 
purposes. The US$10  per tonne increase in the assumed price for iron ore exports is 
expected to result in an increase in nominal GDP of around $ 5.3 billion in  2024 –25, rising to 
aroun d $11.0  billion in 2027 –28. 
The economic response to a permanent change in the price of iron ore is derived from a 
commodity price shock in Treasury’s Macroeconometric Model of Australia.40 The model 
incorporates forward -looking financial markets, which an ticipate the permanent increase 
(or decrease) in commodity prices. An increase in  iron ore export prices leads to a higher 
terms of trade, which leads directly to higher out put prices and nominal GDP. However, 
the appreciation in the exchange rate partially offsets the increase in exports prices and acts

to reduce domestic inflation through lower import prices.  In comparison , Box 2.4: 
Commodity prices illustrates the effect of changing the short -term commodity price 
assumptions on the forecasts for nominal GDP and tax receipts while maintain ing the 
Budget forecasts for  economic activity , the exchange rate  and other prices. This 
methodology is more consistent with how short -run movements  in commodity prices 
would impact the forecasts  for nominal GDP and tax receipts in the budget.   
The volume of output and exports of the mining sector increase in response to higher iron 
ore prices. The higher exchange rate leads to a substitution towards i mports, which 
partially offsets the increase in exports and GDP.   
A US$10  per tonne increase in the assumed price for iron ore exports is expected to result 
in an increase in tax receipts of around $ 0.5 billion in 2024 –25, 2025 –26 and 2026 –27, 
before incre asing to $ 1.9 billion in 2027 –28. An increase in iron ore prices increases 
mining company profits and therefore company tax receipts. This builds over time as 
receipts fully incorporate the lag between when profits are realised and tax is paid by 
companies , with the largest  increase occurring in 2027 –28. Lower domestic prices result 
in lower individuals and other withholding taxes and indirect tax receipts, partially 
offsetting the increase in company tax.

Movements in yields  
Government borrowin g costs are sensitive to yields on Australian Government Securities 
and the level of debt. See Budget  Statement  7: Debt Statement  for further information on 
yields. Given the uncertainty surrounding the global and domestic outlook and the impact 
on yields,  Treasury makes the following technical assumptions:  
• Over the forward estimates, government bond yields are fixed at rates observed 
immediately prior to the Budget update. In the 2024 –25 Budget, the 10-year yield, which 
approximates the average yield on n ew issuance, is assumed to be 4.2 per cent over the 
forward estimates.  
• After the forward estimates, the 10-year bond yield converges linearly towards the 
long -run nominal GDP growth rate over 15  years. This is broadly consistent with the 
long -run approaches of comparable advanced economies. The yield s on other bond 
tenors  are assumed to maintain their historical relativity to the 10-year bond yield.  
The higher yield assumption has bond yields increasing by 1 00 basis  points by 
30 June  2025 . Yields are then held constant over the remainder of the forward estimates to 
2027 –28, before linearly converging to the long -run yield assumption of nominal GDP 
growth over 15  years . The lower yield sensitivity is symmetric  (Chart  8.14). Other economic 
parame ters are assumed to remain unchanged from baseline forecasts to isolate the direct 
impact on fiscal aggregates.

Higher yields increase public debt interest payments  and receipts earned on investments. 
As government interest bearing liabilities usually exceed interest bearing assets, higher 
yields lead to a deterioration in the underlying cash balance. Lower yields h ave the reverse 
effect, improving the underlying cash balance.  
The higher yield assumption results in a deterioration to the underlying cash balance of 
0.3 percentage  points of GDP by 203 4–35 and increases gross debt by 1.9 percentage  points 
of GDP at 30  June 2035 (Chart  8.15).  
The lower yield assumption results in an improvement to the underlying cash balance of 
0.2 percentage  points of GDP by  2034–35. Under the lower yield assumption, cumulative 
improvements to the underlying cash balance reduce gross debt by 1.7 percentage  points of 
GDP at 30  June  2035.

Statement of Risks  
A range of factors may influence the actual budget outcome in future years. The Charter of 
Budget Honesty Act  1998 requires these factors to be disclosed in a statement of risks in each 
Budget and Mid -Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. This Statement outlines general fiscal 
risks, specific contingent liabilities and specific contingent assets that may affect the 
budget  balances.

Risks to the Budget – Overview  
The forward estimates of revenue and expenses in the  2024–25 Budget  incorporate 
assumptions and judgments based on the best information available at the time of 
publication, together with a range of economic assumptions and other forecasts and 
projections.  
Events that could affect fiscal outcomes include:  
• changes in economic and other  parameters, which may be driven by the evolution 
of and responses to domestic and global inflationary pressures, volatility in global 
commodity prices, further global instability stemming from conflicts in Europe and 
the Middle East, and the challenges associated with the transition towards net zero 
emissions  
• matters not included in the fiscal forecasts because of uncertainty about their timing, 
magnitude or likelihood  
• the realisation of contingent liabilities or assets . 
The revenue and expens e estimates and projections published in the 2024–25 Budget  are 
based on a range of economic and other parameters that are consistent with the domestic 
and international outlook detailed in Budget  Statement  2: Economic Outlook . Economic 
outcomes that diffe r from the parameters used in the Budget  represent a material risk to the 
Budget  estimates. Budget  Statement 8: Forecasting Performance & Sensitivity Analysis examines 
the impact on receipts and payments of altering some of the key economic  assumptions  
underlying the Budget  estimates.  
A significant portion of government expenditure is for demand -driven programs. 
Outcomes for these programs could differ from the estimates and projections due to 
changes in economic outcomes, particularly for inflation and  wages growth. For a number 
of demand -driven support programs, including the National  Disability Insurance Scheme, 
aged care programs and health programs, outcomes depend on the wide range of factors 
that affect the take -up of and cost of these programs.  
Revenue forecasting relies heavily on the observed relationships between the economy, 
tax bases and tax revenues. Such relationships may shift over time as the economy changes, 
presenting further risk to the estimates. For example, the ability of entities t o use tax losses 
to offset profits may continue to pose heightened challenges in estimating the profile for 
company and resource tax receipts. Revenue forecasts also incorporate costings for new 
policies that typically involve a degree of uncertainty.  
The estimates and projections of revenue are also subject to general risks that can affect 
taxation collections. These risks  include the ability of the tax system to keep pace with 
changes in the business environment, the potential for tax avoidance, pending court   |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 280  |  Statement 9: Statement of Risks  
decisions and Australian Taxation Office rulings, and the uncertain outcome s of 
compliance programs. The  manifestation of these risks  may result in a shift in the 
composition of taxation collected from the various tax bases or a change in the size of 
the tax base.  
Many agencies rely on external revenue to fund the delivery of some of their services. 
Estimates included in the Budget  for these agencies reflect the latest information about  the 
likely amount  of external revenue they will raise. The externa l revenue actually collected is  
not certain and depend s on some common factors, including economic conditions, which 
can affect estimates for individual agencies and for the Budget as a whole.  
The forward estimates in the Budget  include the impact of all policy decisions, including 
those that remain unlegislated. There is a risk of a variation to the fiscal position outlined in 
the Budget  where legislation is not passed in time for the  commencement of the measure on 
the anticipated commencement date, the l egislation is passed with amendments to the 
original decision, or the legislation fails to pass the Parliament . 
The risks associated with climate change  
Over time, climate change is expected to have a significant impact on the Budget , both in 
terms of risk  and opportunities . The Australian Government is managing these impacts by 
reducing emissions and supporting the economic opportunities presented by the net zero 
transition. However, there is still significant uncertainty about the trajectory of global 
greenhouse gas emissions and the impacts  climate change will have on Australia.  
Climate change can affect macroeconomic and fiscal outcomes  in various ways . These 
include the physical impacts of climate change, the indirect impacts climate change will 
have on  Australia ’s industry mix, and the impacts of policy responses to reduce emissions 
or adapt to the impacts  of a changing climate . Each of these has the potential to affect 
receipts, payments, and the Australian Government ’s balance sheet. They also have the 
potential to influence general economic outcomes, which may , in turn , affect  Budget  
outcomes .  
Policy responses taken by the Australian Government to address climate change include 
the establishment of the Capacity Investment Scheme in the 2023 –24 Budget and its 
expansion in the 2023 –24 MYEFO to drive investment in renewable dispatchable capacity 
and ensure reliability in Australia ’s energy market. The Budget impact of the Capacity 
Investment Scheme will depend on future developments in energy pric es, which may 
present risks that are not fully reflected in the Budget estimates. While the Government has 
opened the first Capacity Investment Scheme tender, contracts have yet to be finalised.  
Specific risks associated with this program will be reflected  in the Statement once contracts 
are finalised and if it is determined that they meet the materiality thresholds for inclusion.  
Measures in the 2024 –25 Budget to reduce emissions in the Australian economy include the 
Hydrogen Production Tax Incentive and Critical  Minerals Production Tax Incentive which 
align with the Government ’s Future Made in Australia agenda . The uncertainty 
surrounding these measures could affect revenue forecasts.  Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 9: Statement of Risks   |  Page 281 
Budget Statement 9: Statement of Risks  sets out specific risks where the y may have an impact 
on the Budget in the Budget year or over the forward estimates period. Some of these risks, 
such as those associated with the cyclone and related flooding reinsurance pool and 
disaster recovery arrangements, are likely to be exacerbate d by climate change over time. 
Other specific risks may emerge that will impact the Budget beyond the forward estimates 
period. These would be included in this Statement when it is apparent that the potential 
impact on the Budget would exceed the materiali ty threshold.  
Special ist Investment Vehicles  
Successive Australian Governments have established Specialist Investment Vehicles (SIVs) 
to achieve policy outcomes. These include the National Reconstruction Fund, Export 
Finance Australia, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and the Northern Australia 
Infrastructure Facility. These SIVs have been established with robust governance 
arrangements, including independent boards, which are charged with making investment 
decisions that manage risk and deliver outcomes in line with each SIV ’s specific investmen t 
mandates.  Details of each SIV is set out in Budget Paper No.  2 or Appendix A to the 
MYEFO  when they are established and, where relevant, presented in the ‘Government 
loans’ section of this Statement, including the total value of loans issued by each enti ty. 
This Statement includes reference to specific risks associated with these SIVs at the time it is 
apparent that those risks associated with the investments exceed or are expected to exceed 
the materiality threshold.   
Specific risks to the Budget  
The Bud get is subject to contingent liabilities. Many  of these reflect indemnities, including 
those relating to the Department of Defence, the Future  Fund Management Agency and 
Future Fund Board of Guardians, and the Reserve  Bank  of Australia. The  Australian  
Gove rnment has also issued guarantees, including  those relating to guarantee schemes for 
the banking and financial sector, payments by Export Finance Australia, and the 
superannuation liabilities of the Commonwealth Bank prior to its sale. Other significant 
contingent liabilities relate to uncalled capital subscriptions and credit facilities to 
international financial institutions and legal cases concerning the Australian  Government. 
The Government has robust and conservative strategies in place to reduce its p otential 
exposure to these contingent liabilities.  
Fiscal risks arise from  general developments or specific events that may affect the fiscal 
outlook. Some developments or events raise the possibility of a fiscal impact. In other cases, 
the likelihood of a fiscal impact may be reasonably certain but will not be included in the 
forward estimates because the timing or magnitude of the impact is not known.  
Table  9.1 outlines how fiscal risks, assets and liabilities, and contingent assets and liabilities, 
are disclosed in the Budget.    |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 282  |  Statement 9: Statement of Risks  
Table  9.2 summarises fiscal risks, contingent liabilities and contingent assets with a possible 
impact on the forward estimates greater than $20  million in any one  year, or $50  million 
over the forward estimates period. Risks that  are new or that have materially changed are 
detailed by portfolio after Table  9.2.  
The Australian  Government ’s annual consolidated financial statements  and the annual 
financial statements of departments and other Government entities also set out i nformat ion 
on contingent liabilities and contingent assets.  
The Government also makes direct loans for policy purposes. All loans contain some 
element of credit risk  (that is, they will not be repaid in full ) although , in many cases , this 
risk is small. Details of Government loans that exceeded $200  million at 30 June  2024  are 
included at the conclusion of Statement  9.

Contingent liabilities – unquantifiable  
Commonwealth liabilities in respect of matching payments to industries for 
research and development contributions  
Under several Acts, the Commonwealth provides matching contributions to encourage 
expenditure on research and development (R&D) and to increas e the competitiveness and 
sustainability of industries within Australia. Matching contributions on eligible R&D  are 
subject  to an annual  limit  that is calculated  based  on the determined  gross  value of 
production (GVP cap) for the industries. There will be a R&D excess, which can be 
claimable  in future  years,  where  the cumulative  R&D  expenditure  is more  than  the GVP  cap. 
The Commonwealth ’s future liability in respect of the matching contributions is contingent 
on the GVP  cap and is therefore  unquantifiable.  
Emergency pest and disease response arrangements  
National emergency response arrangements for animal, plant and environmental pest and 
disease incursions are largely funded through cost -sharing agreements between Australian 
governments and affected agricultural industry bodies. Under the terms of the emergency 
response cost -sharing agreements, the Australian Government is typically liable for 
50 per cent of the total government funding for a nationally agreed response to a pest or 
disease in cursion. Funding is provided in the forward estimates for the Australian 
Government ’s contributions under the emergency response agreements, which are then 
paid to the state or territory governments undertaking relevant activities.  
There are currently 11 n ational cost -shared emergency responses. Since the 2023 –24 Budget, 
the Australian  Government increased the funding for large  scale  responses for the National 
Red Imported Fire Ant Eradication Program in Queensland and the outbreak of 
Varroa  destructor.  
The Australian Government has provided an additional $268.2  million over four years from 
2024–25 for its share of the cost of the revised plan for the National Red Imported Fire Ant 
Eradication Program in Queensland.  
In June  2023, the upper limit of the cost -shared budget for the response to the outbreak 
of Varroa destructor was increased to $132.0  million, with the Australian Government 
committing to contribute 40  per cent of this amount and allocating an additional 
$26.6  million over four  years from 2023 –24 as a provision for underwriting the 
16 cost-sharing industries ’ contributions for this response. In February  2024, the Transition 
to Management plan was endorsed by the participating jurisdictions, with a revised upper 
limit of $100.0  million.

Animal Disease Deed (the Deed) covering aquatic emergency animal diseases and have 
consulted prospective industry signatories. If the Deed is finalised, potential liabiliti es for 
the Australian Government will be increased. The extent of these liabilities will depend on 
which parties sign the Deed and what emergency aquatic incursions occur that would be 
subject to the Deed arrangements.  
White spot syndrome  virus and disease 2016 outbreak  
The Commonwealth is responding to three  claims related to the 2016 outbreak of white 
spot syndrome virus in Queensland. White spot syndrome virus was first detected in South 
East Queensland in  December  2016 and seven prawn farms on the Logan River were 
affected from late  2016 to early  2017.  Prawns on the infected farms were destroyed to 
eradicate the disease as part of a joint industry, Australian and state government response.  
Gold Coast Marine Aquaculture Pty Ltd has filed  a claim in the Federal Court of Australia, 
claiming a breach of a duty to warn by the Commonwealth. Gold Coast Marine 
Aquaculture Pty Ltd alleges that the Commonwealth ’s alleged breach caused, 
or contributed to , the outbreak of white spot syndrome virus i n Queensland ’s Logan River 
in December  2016 and resulting in loss and damage to Gold Coast Marine 
Aquaculture  Pty Ltd.  
A class action has been filed in the Supreme Court of Queensland led by Tweed Bait Pty 
Ltd and TPF  Management Company Pty Ltd on behalf of commercial fishers, handlers and 
wholesalers. The class action seeks compensation for loss and damage suffered as a result 
of the 2016 outbreak of white spot syndrome virus and white spot disease in Queensland ’s 
Logan River area, the Commonwealth ’s impl ementation of biosecurity measures in 
response to the outbreak, and the adverse impacts on consumer demand resulting from 
publicity regarding the outbreak.  
A third claim, an open class action, has been filed in the Supreme Court of Queensland 
against the Commonwealth and is led by M&G Oyster Supplies Pty Ltd. The claim arises 
out of similar circumstances to the Tweed Bait Pty Ltd and TPF Management Company Pty 
Ltd matter. Litigation funding has not yet been secured by the class, despite the matter 
being be fore the court. Should it proceed, the matter is to be case managed alongside 
Tweed Bait.  
Costs associated with these litigation claims or any future litigation relating to the 
2016  outbreak of white spot syndrome virus are not quantifiable until the matte r is 
determined by the Court or otherwise resolved.

Indemnities relating to the Air Security Officer Capability  
The Australian Government has provided an indemnity to two Australian airlines connected 
with agreements to allow Air Security Officers on board their aircraft. The indemnities are 
limited to $2  billion  per incident. The indemnity only applies where the ai rline(s) can establish 
that loss, damage or claim resulted from an act by an Air Security Officer, under or in 
connection with the Air Security Officer program. The indemnity applies to the extent that any 
loss, damage or claim is not covered by existing r elevant insurance policies held by the airline.  
Contingent liabilities – unquantifiable  
Native Title costs  
The Australian Government will likely be liable for any compensation found to be payable 
under the Native Title Act  1993 in respect of compensable a cts for which the Australian  
Government  is responsible. While the High Court ’s decision in the Timber  Creek litigation 
(Northern Territory v Griffiths et al [2019]  HCA  7) provides guidance on the principles for 
calculating compensation under the Native  Title Act, the Australian  Government ’s liability  
cannot  be quantified  owing  to uncertainty  about  the number  and effect of compensable acts, 
and the value of Native Title affected by those  acts.  
Current and prospective investor -state claims against the 
Australian  Government  
The Commonwealt h received  a notice of arbitration from Singapore registered company 
Zeph  Investments Pte Ltd (Zeph) concerning a dispute about the Iron Ore Processing 
(Mineralogy Pty Ltd) Agreement Amendment A ct 2020  (WA) . Zeph raised this claim under 
Chapter  11 (Investment) of the Agreement Establishing  the ASEAN -Australia -New Zealand 
Free Trade Area (AANZFTA) .  
Subsequently, the Commonwealth has received two further notices of arbitration  from 
Zeph . The first  concerns  a dispute about exploration permits held by Waratah Coal Pty Ltd 
(Waratah)  in the Galilee Basin of Queensland. The second concerns a dispute about a coal 
mine proposed by Waratah, also in the Galilee Basin. Zeph raised both these claims under 
Chapter 11 (Investment) of the AANZFTA.  
Should the Australian  Government  be unsuccessful in these proceedings, it would be liable 
for any compensation found to be payable to Zeph . Any such potential liability cannot be 
quantified at this stage.  
The Commonwealth has also received a request for consultation from Zeph concerning  
another potential claim. An i nvestor -state claim ha s not been brought against the 
Australian  Government  in relation to this matter at this time.  Budget Paper No. 1   |

Civil penalty relating to the  Anti-Money Laundering and Counter -Terrorism 
Financing Act  2006  
The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) applied to the 
Federal Court of Australia for civil penalty orders against the following ent ities for alleged 
serious contraventions of the Anti -Money Laundering and Counter -Terrorism Financing 
Act 2006  (AML/CTF Act):  
• the Star Pty Limited and the Star Entertainment QLD Limited on 30  November  2022.  
• SkyCity Adelaide (SkyCity) on 7  December  2022.  
AUSTRAC alleges that these entities failed to comply with obligations under the 
AML/CTF Act, including failures to properly assess money laundering and terrorism 
financing risks, and failures to undertake appropriate customer due diligence.  
The outc omes of these matters are unknown, including whether any penalties will be 
imposed by the Court and, if so, the quantum of any penalties.  
In respect of the SkyCity matter, AUSTRAC has reached an in -principle agreement with 
SkyCity for SkyCity to pay a civi l pecuniary penalty. The amount of the proposed penalty 
remains confidential and settlement is not finalised unless or until the parties reach a final 
agreement with agreed facts and admissions acceptable to AUSTRAC. If an agreement is 
reached, it remains subject to the Court ’s decision as to whether to make the orders agreed, 
including whether the proposed penalty is appropriate. As neither final agreement with 
SkyCity has been reached, nor the Court ’s judgment made, this remains an unquantifiable 
continge nt asset.

Gorgon liquefied natural gas and carbon dioxide storage project – 
long -term  liability  
The Australian and Western Australian (WA) Governments have provided an indemnity to 
the Gorgon Joint Venture Partners (GJV) against independent third -party claims (relating to 
stored carbon dioxide) under common law, for loss  or damage caused by the injection of 
carbon dioxide into the Dupuy formation under Barrow Island, WA. C laims can only occur 
at least 15  years after the cessation of carbon dioxide injections into the formation. The 
project commenced in 2019 and has an exp ected life of around 40  years.  The claims are 
subject to conditions similar to those set out in the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas 
Storage Act  2006 . 
The WA Government has indemnified the GJV and , subject to certain conditions being met,  
the Australi an Government  has indemnified the WA Government for 80  per cent of any 
amount determined to be payable under that indemnity.  
Liability for costs incurred in a national liquid fuel emergency  
The Australian  Government  has responsibility for the Liquid Fuel E mergency Act  1984  
(the Liquid Fuel Act). In addition, the Australian  Government  and state and territory 
governments have entered into an inter -governmental agreement (IGA) in 2006 in relation 
to a national liquid fuel emergency. Under the IGA, the Australian  Government  agrees to 
consult IGA parties on a likely shortage and, if necessary after those consultations, to 
advise the Governor -General of  the Commonwealth of Australia to declare a national 
emergency under the Act.  
The IGA contains three  areas where the Australian  Government  may incur expenses in 
the unlikely event of a national liquid fuel emergency. These relate to the direct costs 
of man aging a liquid fuel emergency and include the possibility of the Australian  
Government  reimbursing the state and territory governments for costs arising from their 
responses, and potential compensation for industry arising from Australian  Government  
direct ions under the Liquid Fuel Act. 
Marinus Link Project  – Shareholders ’ agreement  
The Australian  Government , along  with the Victorian and the Tasmanian Governments , 
has invested  in the joint venture entity Marinus Link Pty Ltd to deliver the Marinus Link 
project. If the three shareholders  decide not to proceed with the project and Marinus Link 
Pty Ltd is wound up, the shareholders may be required to contribute additional equity to  
meet any outstanding liabilities of Marinus Link Pty Ltd .   |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 294  |  Statement 9: Statement of Risks  
Under the shareholders ’ agreement, the Tasmanian Government also has the option to 
sell some or all of its shares to the other shareholders. This option can only be exercised 
following the commence ment of commercial operations of stage one of the project, 
currently scheduled for 2030. While the Victorian Government has the first right of refusal 
to purchase these shares (capped at 16.7  per cent of the Tasmanian Government ’s 
17.7 per cent of the shar eholdings), the Australian  Government  is required to purchase the 
shares that the Victoria n Government does not acquire . Any additional shares purchased 
would be  expected to generate a return in line with the Australian  Government ’s existing 
shareholding i n the entity . 
There are also ongoing project  risks as the project progresses, such as cost pressures, 
that may require additional equity contributions from the shareholders. The 
Australian  Government  will continue to monitor th ese risks through engagement and 
oversight of Marinus Link Pty Ltd ’s activities.  
Murray -Darling  Basin Reform – risk assignment  
The Australian  Government  has committed to bridge the gap between the Baseline 
Diversion Limit and the Sustainable Diversion Limits in the  Basin Plan  2012  through water 
recovery. On 1  July 2019, the Sustainable Diversion Limits took effect. The Water  Act 2007 
provides a risk assignment framework in which entitlement holders with reductions in 
water allocations, or changes in the reliability of water allocations (where the gap has not 
been bridged and an accredited water resource plan is in place), may be eligible for a 
payment from the Commonwealth.  
The total cost of the operation of the risk assignment framework cannot be quantified at 
this time a nd remains a fiscal risk until the gap between the Baseline Diversion Limit and 
Sustainable Diversion Limits is fully  bridged.  
Remediation  of Jabiru Township  
The Australian  Government , the Northern Territory Government,  Gundjeihmi  Aboriginal 
Corporation and Energy Resources of Australia  Ltd signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding in  2019 . The Memorandum of Understanding  underpins the transfer of 
ownership of Jabiru to the Traditional Owners and related make good and rehabilitation 
arrangements. On 26  June  2021, the Australian  Government  officially returned ownership 
of Jabiru to the Traditional Owners. Before  the handover, the Australian  Government  
signed a Remediation and Indemnity Deed between representatives of the Traditional 
Owner s in Jabiru and the Northern Land Council.  
Under these agreements, the Australian  Government ’s responsibilities include  renewal or 
upgrading of some essential services infrastructure (stormwater, landfill and roads), 
managing contamination in Jabiru  Lake,  management or removal of hazardous materials 
and chemicals, replacing asbestos tiled roo fs and improving housing stock, and other 
ecological remediation. Expenditure for the rehabilitation work will be shared between the

United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve Lease Agreement – indemnity under 
certain conditions  
On 3  June  2020, the Australian  Government  entered into a commercial leasing agreement 
with the United States  (US) Department of Energy. This agreement facilitates the storage of 
Australia ’s first government -owned strategic fuel reserve in the US Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve  (SPR).  
Under the lease agreement, the Australian  Government  indemnifies the SPR for any 
liabilities incurred (subject to certain exceptions) arising from or related to: the 
transportation of crude oil to the  SPR; third -party claims made in connection with the 
drawdown or delivery of the oil; and customs duties, fees or other charges which may ar ise 
from the Australian  Government ’s noncompliance with US  Customs Law.  
Following the sale and delivery of all Australian oil held in the  SPR in  June  2022, the risk of 
any liability is currently significantly reduced. Australia continues to maintain its le ase and 
could  decide to store new reserves in the future.

Recovery of inappropriately claimed VET FEE -HELP payments from 
VET providers  
The Australian Government is undertaking compliance action, including court action, 
to recover  VET  FEE-HELP payments from VET  providers where loans were issued 
inappropriately to students by providers. The Government has legislated a remedy, 
which  commenced 1  January  2019, for VET  FEE–HELP students who incurred debts under 
the VET FEE -HELP loan scheme following inappropriate conduct by VET  providers. 
The Government will undertake recovery activities against VET  providers in cases where 
the student was ineligible for a VET FEE -HELP loan.  
There are financial risks to the Commonwealth in the event t hat it cannot  recover payments 
from VET providers where they have closed or entered into administration or liquidation.  
The financial risk to the Commonwealth is currently unquantifiable as it depends on the 
receipt and assessment of applications from stud ents, as well as outcomes from the 
Government ’s investigations into VET providers ’ conduct .

ASC Pty Ltd – Guarantee of Indemnity from ASC in favour of ASC Shipbuilding 
Pty Limited  
The Australian Government has provided a guarantee of an indemnity from ASC Pty Ltd 
(ASC) in favour of ASC Shipbuilding Pty Limited (ASC Shipbuilding).  
ASC provided an indemnity in favour of ASC Shipbuilding prior to ASC Shipbuilding 
being separated from ASC Pty Ltd , which occurred in  December  2018.  This indemnity is 
intended to cover any liabilities unknown at  the time of separation which may arise after 
separation. The indemnity is time limited to seven  years.    |  Budget Paper No. 1

Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation – immunity and indemnity  
The Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Act 2011  (the Governance 
Act) provides specific immunities for activities undertaken in good faith by directors and 
delegates of the board of the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporati on (CSC), provided 
these activities relate to the performance of their functions.  
Under the Governance Act, other than where not permitted by  the Superannuation Industry 
(Supervision) Act 1993  or regulations under that Act, any money that becomes payable b y 
CSC in respect of an action, liability, claim or demand that relates to the superannuation 
schemes or funds for which it is responsible, is to be paid out of the relevant 
superannuation fund or, if there is no fund, the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF). 
Amounts paid from a superannuation fund are reimbursed to the fund from the CRF.  
Finance owned estate  
The Department of Finance owns and is responsible for managing properties in the 
Australian Government ’s domestic non -Defence portfolio, including remedia tion projects 
of contaminated sites to ensure there is no threat to human health and the environment. 
A small number of properties may require remediation and are subject to further 
investigation. Except for properties at Lucas Heights in New  South Wales a nd 
Cox Peninsula in Northern Territory, none of the properties with potential remediation 
issues has had a provision for remediation recognised, as neither the conditions for legal 
nor constructive obligations have been met, nor is a reliable estimate of t he obligation 
currently  possible.

Australian Government and the Australian Capital Territory  (ACT) Government. The  
Australian  Government  is liable  to pay just terms  compensation  if the terms  of the lease 
are breached by introducing new legislation or changing the Canberra Water Supply  
(Googong  Dam) Act  1974  in a way that impacts on the rights of the  ACT. The lease includes 
a requirement for the Australian Government to undertake rectification of easements or 
any defects in title in relation to Googong Dam, and remediation of any contamination it 
may have caused to the  site. It also gives an indemnity in relation to acts or omissions by 
the Australian  Government.  
Indemnities for the Reserve Bank of Australia an d private sector banks  
In accordance with Government entities ’ contracts for transactional banking services, the 
Australian Government has indemnified the Reserve Bank of Australia and contracted 
private sector banks against loss and damage arising from er ror or fraud by an entity, or 
transactions made by a bank with the authority of an entity.

Export Finance Australia – National Interest Account  
There are five financing facilities under Export Finance Australia ’s National Interest 
Account, set out below.  
• The Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIFFP) started operation 
on 1  July 2019. The AIFFP can provide up to $4  billion in facilities, including up to 
$1 billion in grants and the balance in loans and guarantees, to support high priority 
infrastructure development in Pacific countries and Timor -Leste. To date, the 
Australian  Government  has agreed to provide loans, guarantees and grants to support 
the development of 19  infrastructure  projects in ten countries. As at 29 February  2024, 
the maximum loan exposure is $1.1  billion , of which $262.7  million is estimated to be 
drawn down by 30 June 2024.  
• The Critical Minerals Facility (CMF) was established on 28 September 2021 to provide 
finan ce to critical minerals projects in Australia where private sector finance is 
unavailable or insufficient. In the 2023 –24 MYEFO, the Government expanded the 
CMF  by $2.0  billion  for a maximum aggregate exposure of $4.0  billion . To date, the 
Government has a greed to provide a total of approximately $2.15  billion  to support five 
projects under the facility. As at 30  June  2024, $145.9  million is estimated to be drawn 
down from the CMF.  
• The Defence Export Facility (DEF) was established to grow Australia ’s defenc e exports 
by helping to overcome difficulties in accessing private sector finance. The DEF has a 
maximum aggregate exposure of US$3.0  billion . To date, three loans under the DEF 
have been agreed for a total signing value of A$228 million. As at 30  June  2024, 
A$172.9  million is estimated to be outstanding.  
• The COVID -19 Export Capital Facility was announced on 15  April  2020, with a 
maximum aggregate exposure of $500 million. The COVID -19 Export Capital Facility 
expired in  April  2021. As at 30  June  2024, $1.5 million is estimated to be outstanding.  
• The Southeast Asia Investment Financing Facility (SEAIFF) was announced on 
5 March  2024. The SEAIFF will provide up to $2.0  billion  in loans, guarantees, equity 
and insurance for projects that would boost Australian trade and investment in 
Southeast Asia, particularly in support of the region ’s clean energy transition and 
infrastructure development. To date, no funds have been committed under the SEAIFF.  
The Government has also agreed to amend the Export Finance and I nsurance Corporation Act 
1991  to enable Export Finance Australia to finance domestic projects in the national interest  
where they are  consistent with the Future Made in Australia Framework . The Government 
will be able to consider supporting projects on the  National Interest Account through 
financing including debt or equity, where projects are unable to progress solely through 
commercial financing.    |  Budget Paper No. 1

Contingent liability – quantifiable  
Export Finance Australia  
The Australian Government guarantees the due payment of money that is, or may at any 
time become, payable by Export Finance Australia to anyone other than the Government. 
As at 29  February  2024, the Government ’s total contingent liability was $6.4  billion, 
comprising Export Finance Australia ’s liabil ities to third parties ($5.3  billion) and Export 
Finance Australia ’s overseas investment insurance, contracts of insurance and guarantees 
($1.1  billion ). Of the total contingent liability, $2.6  billion  relates to Export Finance 
Australia ’s Commercial Accou nt and $3.8  billion  relates to the National Interest Account.

Fair Work Commission decision – Aged Care Work Value Case  
As the principal funder of the aged care sector, the Australian  Government  has committed 
to provide funding to support any increases to award wages from the Aged Care Work 
Value case that is currently before the Fair Work Commission.  On 15  March  2024, the 
Fair Work Commission made a decision on Stage 3 of the Aged Care Work Value case. 
The operative date and phasing in of the variations to award wages are subject to further 
consideration by the Fair Work Commission.   
Contingent liabilities – unquantifiable  
Accommodation Payment Guarantee Scheme  
The Accommodation Payment Guarantee Scheme guarantees the repayment of aged care 
residents ’ refundable accommodation payments (including refundable deposits and 
accommodation bonds) if the approved provider becomes in solvent or bankrupt and 
defaults on its refund obligations. In return for the payment, the rights that the resident 
had to recover the amount from their approved provider are transferred to the Australian  
Government  so it can pursue the approved provider f or the funds. In cases where the funds 
are unable to be recovered, the Australian  Government  may levy all approved providers 
holding bonds, entry contributions and refundable accommodation deposits to meet 
any shortfall.  
Advance Purchasing Agreements for C OVID -19 vaccines  
The Australian Government has provided indemnities to the suppliers of COVID -19 
vaccines, for which the Australian Government has entered into Advance Purchasing 
Agreements, covering certain liabilities that could result from the use of the vaccines. 
These  agreements support access to vaccines from  AstraZeneca Pty Ltd, Pfizer Inc, 
Moderna Switzerland GmbH and Novavax, Inc . 
Australian Red Cross Society – indemnities  
Deeds of Agreement between the Australian Red Cross Society (the Red Cross) and the 
National Blood Authority in relation to the operation of Australian Red Cross Lifebloo d 
and the development of principal manufacturing sites in Sydney and Melbourne, include 
certain indemnities and a limitation of liability in favour of the Red Cross. These 
indemnities cover defined sets of potential business, product and employee risks and  
liabilities. Certain indemnities for specific risk events that operate within the term of the 
Deed of Agreement are capped and must meet specified pre -conditions. Other indemnities 
and the limitation of liability only operate in the event of the expiry an d non -renewal, or 
the earlier termination, of the Deed of Agreement relating to the operation of the Red Cross 
or the cessation of funding for the principal sites, and only within a certain scope.   |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 308  |  Statement 9: Statement of Risks  
All indemnities are also subject to appropriate limitations  and conditions, including in 
relation to mitigation, contributory fault, and the process of handling relevant claims.  
Blood and blood products liability cover  
The National Managed Fund (NMF) was established by a memorandum of understanding 
between the Aus tralian Government, Australian Red Cross Lifeblood (Lifeblood) and state 
and territory governments to cover potential future claims in relation to the supply of blood 
and blood products by Lifeblood. The NMF provides for liabilities incurred by Lifeblood 
where other available mitigation or cover is not available. Under certain conditions, the 
Australian Government and the state and territory governments may jointly provide 
indemnity for Lifeblood through a cost -sharing arrangement for claims, both current a nd 
potential, regarding personal injury and loss or damage suffered by a recipient of certain 
blood products. If there are insufficient funds in the NMF to cover claim costs, the 
Jurisdictional Blood Committee will consider a report provided by the Nationa l Funds 
Manager to determine the level of additional funds required. The Australian Government ’s 
share of any additional liability is limited to 63  per cent of any agreed net cost.  
CSL Ltd  
CSL Limited (CSL) is indemnified against claims made by individuals  who contract 
specified infections from specified products and against employees contracting 
asbestos -related injuries. CSL has unlimited cover for most events that occurred before 
the sale of CSL on 1  January  1994, but has more limited cover for a specifi ed range of 
events  that occurred during the operation of the Plasma Fractionation Agreement from 
1 January  1994 to 31  December  2004. Where alternative cover was not arranged by CSL, 
the Australian  Government  may have a contingent liability.  
The National F ractionation Agreement for Australia with CSL Behring (Australia) Pty Ltd 
(a subsidiary of CSL), which has operated since 1  January  2018, includes a requirement that 
the National Blood Authority make a defined payment to CSL Behring (Australia) Pty Ltd 
in certain circumstances only, in the event that the volume of plasma supplied annually to 
CSL Behring (Australia) Pty Ltd is less than a specified amount.  
Indemnities relating to vaccines  
The Australian Government has provided indemnities to a manufacturer o f a 
smallpox/monkeypox vaccine held by the Australian Government, covering possible 
adverse events that could result from the use of the vaccine in an emergency situation. 
Indemnities have also been provided to a particular manufacturer of pandemic and 
pre-pandemic influenza vaccines for the supply or future supply of influenza vaccines 
under certain conditions (including H1N1 and  H5N1).  Budget Paper No. 1   |

Major sporting events  
Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games  – On 21  July 2021, the International 
Olympic Committee s elected Brisbane to host the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games. 
On 17 February  2023, the Australian Government and the Queensland Government signed 
a bilateral agreement on matters of shared interest, including a capped capital contribution 
towards venue i nfrastructure by the Australian Government. The Australian  Government  
has also provided a range of guarantees to the International Olympic Committee for 
provision of government services in support of Brisbane hosting the Games, at no cost to 
the Organising  Committee of the Olympic Games. The financial implications of this 
support are not quantifiable at this time.  
2027 Rugby World Cup and 2029 Women ’s Rugby World Cup  – On 12  May  2022, 
World  Rugby selected Australia as the host of the 2027 Rugby World Cup an d the 
2029  Women’s Rugby World Cup. In addition to the financial assistance provided in the 
2022–23 March  Budget to support event delivery and legacy programs, the Government 
has committed to provide services and support (such as security commitments and  visa 
processing for participants and support staff). The financial implication of this additional 
support is not quantifiable at this time.  
2023 FIFA Women ’s World Cup – Between 20  July 2023 and 20  August  2023, Australia and 
New Zealand co -hosted the 2023  FIFA Women ’s World Cup. In addition to the financial 
assistance provided by the Australian  Government  to support direct event delivery costs 
and legacy programs, the Government committed to provide Commonwealth guarantees 
for the event including taxation exemptions. The financial implication of this additional 
support is not quantifiable at this time.  
Medical Indemnity Exceptional Claims Scheme  
Under the Medical Indemnity Exceptional Claims Scheme, the Australian  Government  
assumes liability for 100  per cent of any damages payable against practitioners practising in 
a medical profession that exceed a specified level of cover provided by the practitioner ’s 
medical indemnity insurer (currently $20  million). These arrangements apply to payouts 
either related to a single large claim or to multiple claims that in aggregate exceed the cover 
provided by the p ractitioner ’s medical indemnity insurer, and would apply to claims 
notified under contract -based cover since 2003. From 1  July 2020, the Medical and Midwife 
Indemnity Legislation Amendment Act  2019  provides transferred eligibility for allied health 
profess ionals (including registered only midwives) into the Allied Health High Cost Claims 
Scheme and Allied Health Exceptional Claims Scheme within the Medical Indemnity 
Act 2002 .   |  Budget Paper No. 1

Medical Rural Bonded  Scholarship Waivers  
The Department of Health and Aged Care is  using debt waivers to address the creation 
of statutory debts by participants of the Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship Scheme who 
inadvertently breached contractual arrangements from 2020 , when the reformed Bonded 
Medical Program was implemented. In 2022 –23, the Department of Health and Aged Care 
waived $51.8 million in statutory debts and further waivers may be required. The total 
value of the waivers cannot yet  be quantified.  
mRNA manufacturing facility – indemnities  
The Commonwealth has entered into a strategic partnership with Moderna  Australia Pty 
Ltd (Moderna) to establish domestic mRNA vaccine manufacturing capacity and capability 
in Australia. Under the agreement between the Commonwealth and Moderna, the 
Commonwealth may enter into a pandemic vacci ne advance purchase agreement with 
Moderna for locally manufactured mRNA vaccines in certain circumstances where an 
infectious disease pandemic is declared. Moderna will also have the capacity to supply 
the Commonwealth with non -pandemic vaccines through a  non-pandemic vaccine 
supply  agreement.  
The Commonwealth does provide indemnities to Moderna under these arrangements to 
cover certain liabilities that could result from the implementation of the arrangement.  
There are also indemnities provided by Moderna  in favour of the Commonwealth for 
certain liabilities, which reflect risk  sharing between the parties and are intended to limit 
financial exposure to the Australian  Government . 
Contingent asset – unquantifiable  
Legal action seeking compensation  
The Depart ment of Health and Aged Care is engaged in legal action against certain 
pharmaceutical companies to recover savings denied to the Commonwealth. This is due to 
interim injunctions granted to these companies in unsuccessful patent litigation delaying 
generic  versions of drugs being listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, thereby 
delaying statutory and price disclosure related price reductions for these drugs.

Regional processing arrangements  
Effective 1  January  2022, the Austr alian  Government  supports regional processing 
arrangements in the Republic of Nauru, assisting the Government of Nauru to provide 
support and services to transferees residing in Nauru. Any significant changes in the 
number of transferees, the arrangements that underpin the provision of those services, 
relevant litigation or legislative changes, may incur a cost or generate cost reductions which 
are unquantifiable at this time.

Australian victims of terrorism overseas payment  
The Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Act 2012  
inserted Part 2.24AA into the Social Security Act 1991  to create a scheme to provide financial 
assistance to Australian residents who are victims of an ove rseas terrorist act that has been 
declared by the Prime Minister. The scheme commenced on 22  January  2013. Under the 
scheme, Australian residents who are harmed (primary victims) or whose close family 
member dies (secondary victims) as a direct result of a declared terrorist act are eligible to 
claim one -off payments of up to $75,000. As acts of terrorism are unpredictable, and the 
declaration of overseas terrorists acts discretionary, the cost of the scheme is unquantifiable .  
Disaster Recovery  
The Australian Government provides funding to states and territories through the 
jointly -funded Commonwealth -State Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements (DRFA) to 
assist with natural disaster relief and recovery costs. A state or territory may claim DRFA 
funding if a natural disaster occurs and relief and recovery expenditure for that event meet 
the thresholds set out in the DRFA.  
The forward estimates for the DRFA include preliminary estimates of costs for past events, 
based on the best information avail able at the time of preparation. Preliminary estimates of 
the cost of disaster relief and recovery and the timing of expenditure are subject to change. 
The total cost of relief and recovery from past events may not be completely realised for 
several years.   
For major disasters, the Australian Government may approve payments to individuals, 
such as the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment and Disaster Recovery 
Allowance. As natural disasters and their impacts are unpredictable, the cost of these 
payments for future disasters is unquantifiable and is not included in the forward 
estimates.    |  Budget Paper No. 1

Facilities, garrison, transferee arrivals and reception, and health services in the 
Republic of Nauru – liability  limit 
The Department of Home Affairs entered into two contracts for the provision of services 
and facilities in the Republic of Nauru in relation to regional processing arrangements with 
the following entities:  
• Management & Training Corporation Pty Ltd (MTC), wh ich commenced on 
1 October  2022, for the provision of facilities, garrison and transferee arrival and 
reception services. The contract includes a provision that limits MTC ’s liability to the 
Commonwealth to a maximum of $200  million in aggregate for the te rm of the contract.  
The limitation of liability does not apply to loss arising from claims in relation to death 
or bodily injury, disease or illness of any person caused by MTC ’s breach of contract, 
negligent act or omission, wilful default, or breach of l aw. The limitation of liability also 
does not apply to loss arising from: criminal acts, malicious damage or wilful default of 
the service provider or its subcontractors; statutory penalties; breach of privacy 
legislation; breach of confidentiality; third party claims in relation to infringement of 
intellectual property rights; or claims brought by third parties to the extent they are 
caused by the breach of contract, wilful default, or negligence of the service provider.  
• International Health and Medical Se rvices Pty Ltd (IHMS), which commenced on 
13 August 2022, for the provision of health services in the Republic of Nauru. The 
contract includes a provision that limits IHMS ’ liability to the Commonwealth with an 
indemnity limit of no less than $45  million i n respect of each and every occurrence, and 
in respect of product liability only, and in the aggregate for all occurrences arising 
during any one 12 -month policy period. The limitation of liability does not apply to loss 
arising from claims in relation to death or bodily injury, disease or illness (including 
mental health) of any person caused by IHMS ’ breach of contract, negligent act or 
omission, wilful default, or breach of law. The limitation of liability also does not apply 
to loss arising from: crimin al acts, malicious damage or wilful default of the service 
provider or its subcontractors; statutory penalties; liability that cannot be excluded at 
law; breach of privacy legislation; breach of confidentiality; third party claims in 
relation to infringeme nt of Intellectual Property Rights; or claims brought by third 
parties to the extent they are caused by the breach of contract, wilful default, or 
negligence of the service provider.  
Immigration detention services by state and territory governments – liability limit  
The Department of Home Affairs has negotiated arrangements with some  state and 
territory governments for the provision of various services (including  health, corrective and 
policing services) to immigration detention facilities and people in imm igration detention.  
Some jurisdictions sought indemnification by the Australian  Government  for the provision 
of th ese services. These agreements, listed below, provide unquantifiable indemnities 
relating to any damage or loss incurred by state and territory governments arising out of, 
or incidental to, the provision of services under these agreements.  Budget Paper No. 1   |

Rehabilitation of the Ranger Uranium Mine  
The Australian Government approved the Ranger Uranium Mine (Ranger) in the late 1970s. 
Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA) was authorised to mine uranium at Ranger until 
2021, and is required to rehabilitate the site to achieve an environmental conditi on similar 
to adjacent areas. Pursuant to the renegotiated agreement between the Australian  
Government  and the Northern Land Council, the Australian  Government  would be 
responsible for carrying out rehabilitation works at the Ranger site should ERA  fail 
to complete the works. ERA has provided a rehabilitation security to the Australian  
Government  to cover the expected costs of rehabilitation should it be called upon.  
The rehabilitation security is revalued periodically based on estimated rehabilitation cost s 
at a point in time, and ERA may be required to provide further security if necessary 
following a revaluation. The security currently reflects valuation assumptions as 
at March  2020. Recent assessments of the rehabilitation costs undertaken by the 
Governm ent indicate that the potential costs have increased significantly following 
the last security valuation (in  March  2020) and that, at present, the security held by 
the Australian  Government  would not be sufficient to rehabilitate the site should the 
Austra lian Government be required to do so. The Government acknowledges the 
uncertainty in costing rehabilitation works beyond 2027 and the impact this has on the 
timing of the next security valuation. Until the security can be valued in light of the cost 
uncert ainties being experienced by ERA, the difference between the expected rehabilitation 
costs and the security held by the Australian Government represents a fiscal risk to 
the Budget.  
Significant but remote contingencies  
Liability for damages caused by space  and certain high -power rocket activities  
Under the United Nations Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by 
Space Objects, the Australian Government may be liable to pay compensation for damage 
caused to nationals of other countries by sp ace objects launched from Australia, or by 
Australian nationals overseas. For activities approved under the Space (Launches and 
Returns) Act  2018  the Government also accepts liability for damage suffered by Australian 
nationals, to a maximum value of $3  billion above an insured level.  
To address this risk, in order to have a space or high -power rocket activity approved under 
the Space (Launches and Returns) Act , the  responsible party is required to insure against, or 
take financial responsibility for, damage to third parties. The amount of insurance or 
financial responsibility is capped at $100  million.  
The Space (Launches and Returns) Act  provides  for amounts lower  than $100  million 
depending on the risk profile of the activity. A maximum probable loss methodology is 
also available to calculate the amount of insurance or financial responsibility.  Budget Paper No. 1   |

Operations and maintenance of the Northern Endeavour and associated 
infrastructure  
On 31  March  2022, Petrofac Facilities Management Limited (Petrofac) was engaged to 
deliver Phase One of the decommissioning of the Northern Endeavour. This will see the 
floating production storage and offtake facility (FPSO) disconnected from the sub -sea 
equipment and temporary suspension of the wells. On 30 September 2022, the operational 
control of the facility transitioned from Upstream Production Solutions Pty Ltd to Petrofac.  
The contract with Petrofac has adopted an industry standard “knock-for-knock” risk and 
liability allocation arrangement, akin to the one with Upstream Production Solutions  Pty 
Ltd, that positions risks so that they are borne by the party most likely to be able to 
financially manage the consequences of a risk materialis ing. Petrofac is liable, to a 
pre-determined cap, for several insured risks, including to property, pollution and the 
environment. Petrofac will also bear responsibility for some instances of loss or damage to 
the extent it is caused by Petrofac ’s negligen ce or wilful misconduct.  
The Australian Government has obtained protection and indemnity, facility damage and 
control of well insurance, and taken out membership with oil spill response agencies. These 
limit the Government ’s potential risk and financial ex posure.  
The risk of an incident is remote. The floating production storage offtake facility is being 
maintained with safety critical maintenance carried out, limited oil in storage and no 
further oil production taking place. The additional works to prepare  for disconnection are 
not considered to materially increase the risk.  
The Australian Government has committed to decommission the Northern Endeavour 
FPSO and remediate the Laminaria -Corallina oil fields. The cost to deliver Phase One of the 
decommissionin g, including the disconnection and disposal of the FPSO, is taken into 
account in the forward estimates. However, costs for the subsequent phases of the 
decommissioning  – the permanent plug and abandonment of the wells (Phase Two) and 
the removal of subsea  infrastructure (Phase Three), which are estimated to commence over 
the forward estimates period  – are not able to be fully quantified until procurement 
activities for those Phases have been completed. Actual costs associated with Northern 
Endeavour decomm issioning will be recovered through the Offshore Petroleum (Laminaria 
and Corallina Decommissioning Cost Recovery Levy) Act 2022 .

The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) site contains 
asbestos in several buildings and in the soil at the Lucas Heights campus. Although there is 
potential for claims to be made in relation to asbestos -related diseases, the potentia l costs 
have not been assessed and are unquantifiable contingencies.  
Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation – indemnity  
On 21  April  2016, the then Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science signed a Deed of 
Indemnity between the Australi an Government, ANSTO and ANSTO Nuclear Medicine 
Pty Ltd (ANM), under which the Government formally agreed to indemnify ANSTO and 
ANSTO officers, and ANM and ANM officers, from any loss or liability arising from claims 
caused by ionising radiation. This Dee d will remain in place until  April  2026.  
Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation – legacy waste 
management to final disposal  
ANSTO has accumulated, and will continue to accumulate, nuclear waste, the final 
disposal of which is unfunded. The majority of this waste has arisen from the production 
of nuclear medicine and will require characterisation in order to determine the nature of, 
and therefore the costs and timing required to manage, the waste to final disposal. It is 
anticip ated that the long -term storage of the nuclear waste will be the responsibility of the 
National Radioactive Waste Management Facility. If this changes, ANSTO may need to 
meet the costs of the future management of the waste.  
Former British atomic test site at Maralinga  
The Australian Government is responsible for 14 unlimited indemnities relating to 
the Maralinga Rehabilitation Project  (1995–2000). In  November  2009, the Australian  
Government  agreed to the handback of the former nuclear test site – Maralinga Section  400 
– to the site ’s Traditional Owners, Maralinga Tjarutja. Under the terms of the Maralinga 
Nuclear Test Site Handback Deed , the Australian  Government  has indemnified the 
Maralinga  Tjarutja people and the South Australian  Government  in respect of claims 
arising from test site contamination.  
Land decontamination and site restoration for CSIRO property  
The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has made a 
financial provision for the estimated costs in restoring and decon taminating land where a 
legal or constructive obligation has arisen. For cases where there is no legal or constructive 
obligation, the potential costs have not been assessed and are unquantifiable contingencies.

Fiscal Risks  
Australia Post ’s financial stability  
Australia Post is a Government Business Enterprise wholly owned by the 
Australian  Government . In the 2022 –23 financial year, Australia Post reported a full 
financial year pre -tax loss of $200  million. This is Australia Post ’s first annual loss since 
2014–15. It reflects the way in which digitisation of the global and national economy is 
changing how many people and businesses use postal and related services. Australia Post 
does not receive financial support from the Australian  Government  but is required to meet 
a range of Community Service Obligations.  
 On 6  December  2023, the Australian  Government  announced a package of reforms to 
enable Australia Post to boo st productivity, increase its focus on parcel delivery services, 
and improve financial sustainability. The Government will monitor the implementation of 
these reforms to assess whether they achieve meaningful financial benefits as intended.  
Given the uncertainty surrounding Australia Post ’s financial position, there is a risk that 
the Australian  Government  will need to consider providing financial assistance to Australia 
Post in the future.  
Inland Rail – delivery  
In April  2023, the Australian  Governmen t released the findings of the Independent Review 
of Inland Rail (the Review) and agreed to the 19 recommendations in full or in principle. 
The Review assessed the project ’s scope, schedule and cost. While final project costs will 
not be known until the co mpletion of procurement for all sections of Inland Rail, following 
finalisation of design, planning and gaining environmental approvals, the Review 
identified that the estimated cost to complete Inland Rail will be significantly higher than 
the available f unding.  
The Australian  Government  will work with independent specialists to review the cost, 
scope, engineering, delivery models and schedule of the project. In the interim, Inland Rail 
Pty Ltd (IRPL) is prioritising the delivery of sections from Beveridge  to Parkes.  
The major funding source available to the Australian Rail Track Corporation/IRPL to 
deliver Inland Rail is Commonwealth equity investment. Pre -existing project risks have 
been realised, including extensive delays and cost increases. Significant  project delivery 
risks will remain, including securing jurisdictional support, cost and scheduling pressures,  
pre-existing land and contamination, and realising revenues.

Significant but remote contingencies  
Inland Rail – Termination of the Equity Finan cing Agreement  
The Australian  Government  will provide sufficient funding to cover all costs and liabilities 
incurred by the Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC) or Inland Rail Pty Ltd for 
delivery of Inland Rail in the event the Commonwealth terminates  the Equity Financing 
Agreement between the Commonwealth and the ARTC.  
Maritime Industry Finance Company Limited – Board Members ’ indemnity  
Indemn ities for Maritime Industry Finance Company Limited (MIFCO) board members 
were provided to protect them agains t civil claims relating to their employment and 
conduct as Directors. MIFCO was placed into voluntary liquidation in  November  2006 and 
was deregistered on 24  April  2008. The indemnity is not time -limited and continues even 
though the company has been liqui dated. Until the indemnity agreements are varied or 
ended, they will remain as contingent and unquantifiable liabilities.  
Moorebank Intermodal Project – Glenfield Waste Site Easement  
The Australian  Government  has provided an indemnity to cover all costs an d liabilities that 
may be incurred by the Grantor (the private sector owner of the Glenfield Waste Site) of 
any easement for the rail spur going across the Glenfield Waste Site, to the extent such costs 
or liabilities are caused or contributed to by the Co mmonwealth or its agents.  
National Intermodal Corporation  Limited – Termination of the Funding 
Agreement  
The Australian  Government  has provided an indemnity to cover all costs and liabilities that 
may be incurred by the National Intermodal Corporation Limited ( National Intermodal ) if 
the Commonwealth terminates the Funding Agreement between the Commonwealth and 
National Intermodal . 
Telstra Financial Guarantee  
The Australian Government has provided Telstra Corporation Limited (Telstra) a 
guarantee in res pect of NBN Co ’s financial obligations under the Definitive Agreements. 
The Agreements were amended on 14  December  2014. The Guarantee was not amended at 
that time and it continues in force in accordance with its terms in respect of the amended 
Definitive Agreements. The liabilities under the Definitive Agreements between Telstra and 
NBN Co arise progressively during the roll -out of the National Broadband Network as 
Telstra’s infrastructure is accessed and Telstra ’s customers are disconnected from its coppe r 
and Hybrid Fibre Coaxial cable networks. The Australian Government is only liable in the 
event NBN Co does not pay an amount when due under the Definitive Agreements. As at 
28 February  2024, NBN Co had liabilities covered by the Guarantee estimated at $1 1 billion.  Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 9: Statement of Risks   |  Page 319 
The Guarantee will terminate when:  
• NBN Co achieves specified credit ratings for a period of two continuous years  
• the company is capitalised by the Commonwealth to the agreed amount  
• the Communications Minister declares, under the National Broadband Network Companies 
Act 2011 , that, in his or her opinion, the National Broadband Network should be treated 
as built and fully operational. This declaration was made on 11  December  2020.  
Tripartite deeds relati ng to the sale of federal leased airports  
The tripartite deeds between the Australian Government, the airport lessee company and 
financiers, amend airport (head) leases to provide for limited step -in rights for financiers in 
circumstances where the Austral ian Government terminates the head lease to enable the 
financiers to correct the circumstances that triggered such a termination event. The 
tripartite deeds may require the Australian Government to pay financiers compensation as 
a result of terminating the  (head) lease, once all Australian  Government costs have been 
recovered. The Australian Government ’s contingent liabilities are considered to be 
unquantifiable and remote.  
WSA Co Limited – Board Members ’ indemnities  
The Australian Government has provided a n indemnity to the inaugural directors of 
WSA  Co Limited (WSA Co) to protect them against certain claims relating to their role as 
directors. Unless the indemnity agreements are varied or ended, they cease to apply from 
the date the Commonwealth has fully satisfied its obligations to subscribe for equity in 
WSA Co pursuant to the WSA Co Equity Subscription Agreement.  
WSA Co Limited – Sydney Metro – Western Sydney Airport indemnity  
The Australian Government has provided an indemnity to cover liabilities that  may be 
incurred by WSA Co related to the integration of the Sydney Metro – Western  Sydney 
Airport project (delivered by the New South Wales  Government) with the Western Sydney 
International (Nancy -Bird Walton) Airport, to the extent such liabilities are e stablished in 
the Airport -Rail Integration Deed.  
WSA Co Limited – Termination of the Equity Subscription Agreement  
The Australian Government is required to cover all costs and liabilities that may be 
incurred by WSA Co if the Commonwealth terminates the Eq uity Subscription Agreement 
between the Commonwealth and WSA  Co.   |  Budget Paper No. 1

Contingent liabilities – unquantifiable  
Australian Maritime Safety Authority – ship-sourced pollution incident costs  
In the normal course of operations, shipowners carry the liability for any clean -up costs 
following a ship -sourced pollution incident. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority 
(AMSA) is responsible for the provision of interim funds necessary to immediately meet  
clean -up operations and, in all circumstances, see ks to recover these costs from ship owners.  
AMSA has established a pollution response financial capability of $50  million, backed by 
liquid investments, to provide funds for clean -up costs (which may be across a range of 
concurrent incidents) to cover exp enditure pending recoveries.  
The Australian Government meets costs that cannot be recovered. Given the nature of  
ship -sourced pollution incidents, it is not possible to estimate the amounts of any eventual 
payments that may be required.  
Aviation rescue an d firefighting services potential per - and poly -fluoroalkyl 
substances contamination  
The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and 
the Arts (DITRDCA) has identified a number of sites in Australia potentially contamin ated 
with per - and poly -fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which were contained in firefighting 
foams.  
PFAS  contaminants do not naturally break down in the environment and several have been 
listed on the Stockholm Convention as  persistent contaminants. Austral ian health and 
environmental agencies have set a range of standards for environmental protection and 
precautionary health measures.  
Up to 37 airport sites are potentially contaminated with PFAS (20 federally -leased airports 
and 17 regional airports), which  relate to the Australian Government ’s provision of 
firefighting services. DITRDCA is undertaking PFAS investigations at these airports to 
understand the risks and develop management plans for any identified PFAS 
contamination. These investigations are fun ded under DITRDCA ’s $130.5  million PFAS 
Airports Investigation Program (the Program). Airservices Australia (Airservices) is 
continuing to implement the National PFAS Management Program, which includes 
ongoing PFAS investigations at 18 airport sites. The c osts of potential long -term 
management options cannot be quantified at this time.  
For Commonwealth -owned airports that are leased on a long -term basis, Airport Lessee 
Companies are responsible for environmental management of their airport sites. Airport 
leases indemnify the Commonwealth in relation to damages or injury to the environment, 
including in respect of costs and claims arising due to such damages or injury. However, 
these leases do not indemnify Airservices, as it is a corporate Commonwe alth entity. The 
Commonwealth is not indemnified for 16 airports (which are privately or local government 
owned) in the Program ’s scope because the Commonwealth is not a party to any lease deed Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 9: Statement of Risks   |  Page 321 
at these airports. The costs of potential long -term management  options cannot be quantified 
at this time.  
A number of Airport Lessee Companies have requested that the Airport Environment 
Officer (AEO) issue remedial orders to Airservices for PFAS contamination under the 
Airports (Environment Protection) Regulations 1 997. On 30  March  2023, the AEO issued 
Airservices with an environmental remedial order in relation to PFAS contamination 
caused by Airservices at the former fire training ground at Launceston Airport. AEOs 
are also actively considering regulatory action at  Brisbane, Canberra, Moorabbin and 
Sydney  Airports.  
Brisbane Airport Corporation has commenced legal proceedings in the Queensland 
Supreme Court against Airservices concerning  legacy PFAS contamination from 
Airservices ’ use of firefighting foams containing  PFAS at the airport. Australia Pacific 
Airports Launceston and Perth Airport Pty Ltd have also commenced legal proceedings 
against Airservices in relation to PFAS contamination in the Federal Court. Potential costs 
relating to th ese matter s are unquantifi able at this time . 
Indemnity provided to the New South Wales Rural Fire Fighting Service in 
relation to the Jervis Bay Territory  
The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and 
the Arts ( DITRDCA ) engages the New South Wales Rural Fire Service (NSW RFS) to 
provide fire management in the Jervis Bay Territory (JBT). To provide these services, the 
NSW RFS requires the Australian Government to provide an uncapped indemnity against 
any actions or claims  resulting from the actions of the NSW RFS while providing fire 
management services in the JBT. The indemnity covers the same period of time for which 
NSW RFS is engaged to provide the fire management services. The likelihood of an event 
occurring that may  result in a liability for the Australian Government is assessed as 
unlikely. The risk of a liability is mitigated through a range of risk management measures, 
including the Jervis Bay Territory Rural Fires Ordinance 2014 , the establishment of a 
JBT Emerge ncy Management Committee (EMC), a fire management plan prepared and 
implemented by the EMC, NSW RFS staff training and professional qualifications and 
DITRDCA actively managing the Service Level Agreement with the NSW RFS.  
Moorebank Intermodal Project – Georges River rail crossing  
The Australian  Government  has provided  an indemnity  to cover  costs  and liabilities  that may  
be incurred  by the State  of New  South  Wales  arising  under  the Native  Title  Act 1993  (Cth) 
associated with the construction of a rail bridge over the Georges River to the Moorebank 
Intermodal Terminal. The likelihood of costs being incurred is considered remote and 
potential costs are unquantifiable.    |  Budget Paper No. 1

Service Delivery Arrangement Indemnities – Indian Ocean Territories and 
Jervis  Bay Territory  
Since  1992, the Australian Government has enter ed into Service Delivery Arrangements 
with the Western Australian (WA) Government for the provision of services to the Indian 
Ocean Territories of Christmas I sland and the Cocos  (Keeling)  Islands. The Australian  
Government  has provided certain indemnities for the WA Government  and its respective 
officers, agents, contractors and employees against civil claims relating to their 
employment and conduct as officers . 
The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) provides services to the Jervis  Bay Territory under 
a Memorand um of Understanding. The Australian Government has provided certain 
indemnities for the ACT Government authorities and officials in relation to  the deliv ery of 
services to the Jervis Bay Territory.  
The likelihood of an event occurring that may result in a liability for the Australian  
Government  has been assessed as remote and the risks are currently mitigated through the 
training and professional qualifica tions of the staff of these agencies  and the existence of 
systems, processes and standards for the delivery of services.

Fiscal Risks  
COVID -19 and disaster social security  debt pause for specified areas  
The Australian Government implemented a temporary pause on a range of debt activities 
from 4  August  2021 in New South Wales, Victoria, the Australian  Capital Territory and 
11 Local Government Areas  in South East Queensland. This was undertaken to help 
ease  pressure on people subject to stay at home orders and natural disaster impacts. 
Since  1 July 2022, consistent with the easing of COVID -19 restrictions, Services Australia 
has progressively lifted debt pauses associated with the pandemic and natural disast ers.  
There is currently an unquantifiable financial risk as the financial impacts of the debt pause 
over  2020–21 and  2021–22 are yet to be fully realised.  
National Disability Insurance Scheme  
The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) provides Austr alians with permanent 
and significant disability with financial support to build capacity, increase independence 
and establish stronger connections with their community.  
As with other demand -driven programs, the estimated costs for the NDIS are subject to 
adjustments to reflect observed changes in actual payments. As the Scheme is relatively 
new, there is greater potential for changes in forecasts of the number of participants, the 
funds alloc ated in participant support packages, the payments by participants from those 
funds for supports, and the resourcing required by the National Disability Insurance 
Agency to administer the Scheme.  
National Cabinet has committed to a NDIS Financial Sustainability Framework to ensure 
the Scheme is sustainable in the long term, with an annual growth target for Scheme costs 
of no more than 8  per cent from 1  July 2026. On 27  March  2024 the Government introduced 
the National Disability Insurance Scheme Am endment (Getting the NDIS Back on Track) 
Bill 2024 No. 1 (the Bill) to Parliament. Changes in the Bill and subsequent amendments to 
NDIS rules and other legislative instruments will moderate growth in NDIS expenditure, 
by determining NDIS participant plan budgets more consistently based on participant need 
and supporting participants to spend in accordance with their plans. The realisation of the 
financial projections for the NDIS is dependent on the successful implementation of the 
Financial Sustainability  Framework, including the passage of the Bill and subsequent 
changes to NDIS rules and other legislative instruments.  Budget Paper No. 1   |

Income apportionment and debt pause  
Following legislative changes made in  November  2020, from 7  Dece mber  2020 the 
Australian Government ceased calculating a customer ’s income support entitlements for 
debts arising through income apportionment. This method was used in certain instances 
to evenly divide or apportion a customer ’s employment income across tw o or more 
Centrelink fortnightly reporting periods. The legislative changes in  November  2020 
simplified income reporting: income is now reported when it is received, removing the 
need for customers to calculate and report what they have earned each fortnig ht.  
Where income apportionment was or may have been applied to recover certain 
Commonwealth social security debts prior to 7  December  2020, recovery activities have 
been paused while the Australian Government investigates a resolution.  
Contingent asset – quantifiable  
National Redress Scheme  
The National Redress Scheme  for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Act 2018  aims to support 
people who experienced institutional child sexual abuse from institutions participating 
in the National Redress Scheme to gain ac cess to counselling and psychological services, 
a direct personal response from the responsible institution, and a monetary payment. 
The Department of Social Services (DSS) administers the National Redress Scheme. In this 
capacity, DSS makes the monetary p ayment to the survivor and then recovers the costs 
from the institution determined to be responsible for the abuse.  
As at 5 March  2024, DSS has an administered quantifiable contingent asset of $374. 1 million 
in relation to the probable recovery from responsible institutions of monetary payments 
that may be made to survivors under the National Redress Scheme.  The value is based on 
applications that have been referred to an independent decision maker for assessmen t and 
the payment values.  
As at 5 March  2024, DSS has an administered quantifiable contingent liability of 
$195. 5 million  in relation to applications made under the National Redress Scheme  that 
have been referred to an independent decision maker for assess ment. The amount is based 
on the number of applications and the payment values.  
The difference between the contingent asset and the contingent liability represents the net 
risk to the Budget from the National Redress Scheme.

Significant but re mote contingencies  
Asbestos Injuries Compensation Fund  
In February  2016, the Commonwealth agreed to assume one  third of the default risk 
associated with a $320 million New South Wales (NSW) Government loan to the Asbestos 
Injuries Compensation Fund (AICF), contingent on all states and territories agreeing to 
assume the remaining default risk. States and territories agreed to assume the remaining 
default risk in the period following the publication of the 2016 –17 Budget.  
The AICF provides compensation  to Australian asbestos disease related claims against 
former subsidiaries of the James Hardie Group and is funded on an ongoing basis through 
contributions from the James Hardie Group. NSW provided a $320  million loan facility in 
2010 to enable AICF to co ntinue to pay compensation as lump sums, rather than on an 
instalment basis.  
Financial Claims Scheme  
The Financial Claims Scheme provides depositors of authorised deposit -taking institutions 
(ADIs) and claimants against general insurers with timely access to their funds in the event 
of a financial institution failure.  
Under the Banking Act 1959 , the Financial Claims Scheme  provides a mechanism for 
making payments to depositors under the Australian Government ’s guarantee of deposits 
in ADIs. Payments are ca pped at $250,000 per account holder per ADI. The total value of 
deposits eligible for coverage under the Financial Claims Scheme was estimated at 
$1.3 trillion as at 3 1 December  2023.  
Under the  Insurance  Act 1973 , the Financial Claims Scheme provides a me chanism for 
making payments to eligible beneficiaries with a valid claim against a failed general 
insurer. It is not possible to estimate the amounts of any eventual payments that may be 
required in relation to general insurance claims.  
In the very unlike ly event of an ADI or general insurer failure, any payments made under 
the Financial Claims Scheme would be recovered through the liquidation of the failed 
institution. If there was a shortfall in the amount recovered through the liquidation of the 
failed institution, a levy could be applied to the relevant industry to recover the difference 
between the amount expended and the amount recovered in the liquidation.  
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is responsible for the 
administration of  the Financial Claims Scheme. Under the Financial Claims Scheme, any 
payments to account holders with eligible protected accounts or eligible claimants would 
be made from APRA ’s Financial Claims Scheme Special Account. Under the legislation, 
upon declarati on by the Minister in relation to a specified ADI, up to $20  billion  per 
institution would be available to meet Financial Claims Scheme payments and up to 
$100  million per institution for administration costs.  Budget Paper No. 1   |

Guarantee  for Housing Australia  
The Australian Government guarantees the due payment of money payable by Housing 
Australia to anyone other than the Government.  
The Housing Australia Board must not allow Housing Australia to enter into a transaction 
that would result in its total guaranteed l iabilities, and any outstanding amount borrowed 
from the Government, to exceed $7.5  billion , unless approved by the Government.  As part 
of the 2024 –25 Budget, the Government announced the cap on the Government guarantee 
of Housing Australia ’s liabilities w ill increase from $7.5  billion  to a total of $10  billion  on 
1 July 2024.  
Guarantees under the Commonwealth Bank Sale Act  1995  
Under the terms of the Commonwealth Bank Sale Act 1995 , the Australian  Government  
guarantees various superannuation and other liab ilities of the Commonwealth Bank.  As at 
31 December  2023, the  Commonwealth Bank of Australia holds no attributed liabilities,  and 
$4.27  billion  is attributable to liabilities of the Commonwealth Bank Officers ’ 
Superannuation Corporation.  
Reserve Bank of Australia – Guarantee  
The Australian Government guarantees the liabilities of the Reserve Bank of Australia, 
measured as the Bank ’s total liabili ties excluding capital, reserves, and 
Australian  Government  deposits. The principal component of the Bank ’s liabilities consists 
of exchange settlement balances. As at 29 February  2024 , exchange settlement balances 
amount to $ 335.4  billion , and the total g uarantee is $ 453.3  billion . 
Contingent liabilities – unquantifiable  
Compensation scheme of last resort  
The compensation scheme of last resort (CSLR) will facilitate the payment of compensation 
to consumers who have an eligible determination from the Austra lian Financial Complaints 
Authority which remains unpaid, primarily due to the insolvency of the relevant financial 
service provider.  
Legislation to establish the CSLR was passed on 22  June  2023. The CSLR will be funded by 
the Government in the first levy period, which ends 30  June  2024. Thereafter, liabilities 
under the CSLR will transfer to the financial services sector and will be funded by levies on 
the sector.  
The value of the Australian Government ’s liabilities under the CSLR is unquantifiable. T he 
collapse of Dixon Advisory and Superannuation Services Pty Ltd substantially increased 
the backlog of potential eligible claims.    |  Budget Paper No. 1

Establishment of a cyclone and related flooding reinsurance pool  
The Government provides an annually reinstated Government g uarantee to the Australian 
Reinsurance Pool Corporation (ARPC) of $10  billion , or a larger amount if required, to 
support a reinsurance pool for the impact of cyclones and related flooding on eligible 
insured properties. The guarantee took effect from 1  July 2022, following the passage of 
legislation in  March  2022, and may be called upon in the event of a large cyclone and 
related flooding, or in a year with a high number of cyclones and related flooding, to 
ensure the ARPC can pay any and all liabilities.  
The reinsurance pool is designed to be cost  neutral to Government over time, based on the 
predicted cost and frequency of cyclone events. The estimated value and range of calls on 
the guarantee is unquantifiable due to significant uncertainty in the freque ncy and severity 
of cyclones and the resulting losses.  
Government guarantees for housing  
The Australian Government has several  programs to support individuals to enter the 
housing market sooner. These are administered by Housing Australia.   
The First Home Guarantee  (formerly the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme) is designed to 
support eligible first home buyers, and non -first home buyers who have not owned a 
property in Australia within the past ten years, to build or purchase a home by providing a 
guarantee to participating lenders for up to 15  per cent of the property purchase price. 
The First Home Guarantee began on 1  January  2020.  
The New Home Guarantee is designed to support eligible first home buyers seeking to 
build a new home or purchase a ne wly built home by providing a guarantee to 
participating lenders for up to 15  per cent of the property purchase price. A second tranche 
of 10,000  New Home Guarantees was made available from 1  July 2021. The New Home 
Guarantee concluded on 30  June  2022  but its guarantees issued in previous financial years 
remain active.  
The Family Home Guarantee  is designed to support single parents  and single legal 
guardians  with dependents seeking to enter, or re -enter, the housing market . The Family 
Home Guarantee commen ced on 1  July 2021.  
The Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee is designed to support eligible first home 
buyers and  non-first home buyers who have not owned a property in Australia within the 
past ten years, to build or purchase a home in a regional locatio n by providing a guarantee 
to participating lenders of up to 15  per cent of the property purchase price (subject to a 
minimum deposit of 5  per cent). The Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee commenced on 
1 October  2022.  
For the four programs listed above, the Australian Government guarantees the liabilities as 
they arise. Guaranteed liabilities arise where a lender ’s loss is covered by the guarantee. 
The lender then makes a claim against the guarantee and Housing Australia  assesses  the 
claim. Given liabilities under the Scheme are met by a standing appropriation, Housing Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 9: Statement of Risks   |  Page 329 
Australia  is not required to maintain capital and reserves to meet the liabilities associated 
with these programs.  
Indemnities for specialised external advisers dur ing the COVID -19 pandemic  
The Government has provided indemnities for certain specialised external advisers 
engaged to provide advice on emerging markets issues related to  COVID -19. Indemnities 
were provided to mitigate personal risk and provide coverage f or costs related to any legal 
proceedings that may arise in relation to the provision of that advice.  
The indemnities apply for the period of engagement as advisers and for claims that are 
notified within 12  years after cessation of the adviser ’s engagemen t. Until the indemnity 
agreements are varied or expire, they will remain as contingent and unquantifiable 
liabilities.  
Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Guarantee Scheme and SME Recovery 
Loan  Scheme  
The Australian Government provided support for small and medium enterprises during 
the COVID -19 pandemic through guaranteeing loans issued by participating lenders. 
This  support was provided under a number of schemes.  
The Coronavirus Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) Guarantee Scheme  provided a 
guarantee of  50 per cent of the eligible loan amount for eligible SMEs and the Show Starter 
Loan Scheme  provided a guarantee of 100  per cent of the eligible loan amount for the arts 
and entertainment businesses, with both schemes closing for new loans on 30  June  2021.  
The SME Recovery Loan Scheme , an expansion and extension of the Coronavirus SME 
Guarantee Scheme, provided a guarantee of up to 80  per cent of the eligible loan amount, 
and was initially available to applicants from 1  April  2021 until 31  December  2021.  
The SME Recovery Loan Scheme was extended from 1  January  2022 to 30  June  2022, and 
during this period the Government provided a guarantee of 50  per cent of the eligible 
loan  amount.  
Under each of the above schemes, the Australian  Government guaranteed to pay an 
approved lender in the event of default by small and medium enterprises. Although all 
schemes have closed to new loans, the risk to the Australian  Government remains until the 
final claim date for SME Recovery Loan Scheme on 30  Septemb er 2033.  
Terrorism insurance – commercial cover  
The Terrorism and Cyclone Insurance Act 2003  (formerly the Terrorism Act 2003 ) established 
a scheme for terrorism insurance covering damage to commercial property, including 
associated business interruption and public liability (extended in  2017 to mixed -use and 
high -value residential buildings). The  Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation (ARPC) 
uses reinsurance premiums paid by insurers to meet its administrative expenses, to 
maintain a pool of funds and to  purchase reinsurance to help meet future claims.   |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 330  |  Statement 9: Statement of Risks  
The Australian  Government guarantees to pay any liabilities of the ARPC, however the 
responsible Minister (or delegate) must declare a reduced payout rate to insured entities if 
the Government ’s liability w ould otherwise exceed $10  billion.  
Contingent liabilities – quantifiable  
Australian Taxation Office – tax disputes  
At any point in time, the Australian Taxation Office is involved in a range of dispute 
resolution processes, including litigation, relating t o tax disputes.  
Details of the outcome of dispute resolution processes remain uncertain until a court ruling 
is made and/or an agreement is reached with the taxpayer. Accordingly, in most cases it is 
not possible to reliably estimate the likely financial i mpact of current disputes. The 
estimated aggregate value of tax in dispute as at  29 February  2024 , for which a provision 
has not been made, is $ 9.7 billion . 
Outcomes of dispute resolution processes are included in the Commissioner of Taxation ’s 
Annual Report each year. This may include disputes resolved through objections,  
settlements and court and tribunal decisions. It may also include amounts owed by 
taxpayers that are subject to dispute but not finalised.  
International financial  institutions – uncalled capital subscriptions  
The Australian Government has held an uncalled capital subscription in the International 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) since 1947. Australia ’s current uncalled 
capital subscription to the IBRD totals around  US$4. 4 billion  (estimated value A$6. 6 billion  
as at 14 March  2024 ). 
The Australian Government has an uncalled capital subscription in the European Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) since 1991. Australia ’s uncalled capital 
subscription to the EBRD totals around EUR237.5  million (estimated value A$396. 9 million 
as at 14 March  2024 ). 
The Australian Government has held an uncalled capital subscription in the Asian 
Development Bank (ADB) since 1966. Australia ’s uncalled capital subscription to the 
ADB  totals around US$7.0  billion  (estimated value A$10. 6 billion  as at 14 March  2024 ). 
The Australian Government has an uncalled capital subscription in the Multilateral 
Investment Guarantee Agency of around US$26.5  million (estimated v alue A$40. 0 million 
as at 14 March  2024 ). 
The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) was established on 25  December  2015. 
The Australian Government has subscribed to shares in the AIIB, which includes an 
uncalled capital subscription. Australia ’s unca lled capital subscription to the AIIB totals 
around US$3.0  billion  (estimated value A$4.5  billion  as at 14 March  2024 ). Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 9: Statement of Risks   |  Page 331 
None of these international financial institutions has ever drawn on Australia ’s uncalled 
capital subscriptions.  
International Monetary Fund – 16th General Review of Quota  
The Australian Government has agreed to approve a 50  per cent increase to the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) quota. Under the agreement, Australia ’s quota will 
increase from Special  Drawing Rights (SDR)  6.6 billion  (approximately A$13.3  billion  as 
at 14 March  2024 ) to SDR  9.9 billion  (approximately A$19.9  billion  as at 14 March 2024 ). 
This increase maintains Australia ’s voting power at the IMF and share of any future 
SDR  allocation a nd increases access to fund financing. The timing of the contribution 
is uncertain, it will come into effect no earlier than 15  November  2024 and is subject to 
conditions including consent by members representing 85  per cent of existing quota. 
25 per cent of the increase, SDR  821.55  million (approximately A$1. 7 billion  as 
at 14 March  2024 ), will be made in foreign currency (in consultation with the IMF) and 
the remainder will be covered by Australian dollar denominated promissory notes. If the 
IMF quota increase is implemented it will be largely offset by reductions in Australia ’s 
other IMF commitments.  
International Monetary Fund – New Arrangements to Borrow & Bilateral 
Borrowing  Agreement  
Australia has made a line of credit available to the Intern ational Monetary Fund (IMF) 
under its New Arrangements to Borrow since 1998. This is a contingent loan to help ensure 
that the IMF has the resources available to maintain stability in the global economy. 
On 8 October 2020, the Treasurer advised the IMF tha t Australia consented to the 
New  Arrangements to Borrow decision and, on 26  January  2020, the IMF Executive Board 
approved amendments to the New Arrangements to Borrow decision, including increasing 
the credit arrangements of all participants and extending  the arrangement from 
1 January  2021 to 31  December  2025. The value of Australia ’s New Arrangements to 
Borrow credit arrangement stands at around  Special Drawing Rights  (SDR)  4.4 billion  
(estimated value A$9.0  billion  at 14  March  2024). If the IMF quota in crease is implemented , 
the value of Australia ’s NAB contribution will decrease by SDR 0.7  billion  to SDR 
3.7 billion  (approximately A$7. 5 billion  as at 14 March  2024 ). 
Australia has also made available approximately SDR 2.0  billion  (estimated as 
approximately A$4. 0 billion  at 14  March  2024) through a contingent bilateral loan to the 
IMF, known as a Bilateral Borrowing Agreement (BBA). This contingent bilateral loan is 
on terms consistent with other bilateral loans and note purchase agreements between the 
IMF and other contributing countries. The contingent bilateral loan will be drawn upon 
by the IMF only if needed to supplement the IMF ’s quota and New Arrangements to 
Borrow resources, and any drawings on loans would be repaid in ful l, with interest. On 
26 July 2023, Australia agreed to extend the BBA by one year through to 31  December  2024. 
If the IMF quota increase  is implemented in 2024 , Australia ’s BBA will be allowed to expire. 
If the implementation of the quota increased is dela yed beyond end -2024, the IMF may seek 
to negotiate a transitional BBA with Australia .   |  Budget Paper No. 1

International Monetary Fund  – Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust  
The Australian Government has entered into agreements to make a line of credit available 
to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust 
through to 31  December  2029. The Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust provides 
concessional financial support to low -income countries to help them achieve, maintain, or 
restore a stable and sustainable macroeconomic position. Poverty Reduction and Growth 
Trust funds are drawn upon by the IMF as needed and will be repaid in full, with interest.  
Through these agreements, the Government has made available Special Drawing Rig hts 
(SDR ) 1 billion  (approximately A$2. 0 billion  as at 14  March  2024) to loan to the IMF under 
the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust. As at 30  June  2024, SDR 257.0  million 
(approximately A$ 518.6 million) has been drawn down, leaving  SDR 743.01  million 
(approximately A$1. 5 billion ) available to the IMF under the Poverty Reduction and 
Growth Trust . 
International  Monetary Fund  – Resilience and Sustainability Trust  
On 11 October 2022, the Australian Government entered into an agreement to make a line 
of credit  of Special Drawing Rights ( SDR ) 760 million (approximately A $1.5 billion  as at 
14 March  2024 ) available to the IMF under the Resilience and Sustainability Trust through 
to 30  November  2030. The Resilience and Sustainability Trust will provide affordable 
long -term financing to help vulnerable countries build resilience and sustainability to 
address the risks stemming from climate change and pandemic preparedness. Resilience 
and Sustainability Trust line of credit funds are drawn upon by the IMF as needed and 
will be repaid in full , with interest. As at 30  June  2024, SDR 14.2  million (approximately 
A$28.6 million  as at 14 March  2024 ) has been drawn down, leaving SDR 745.8  million 
(approximately A$1.5  billion  as at 14 March  2024 ) available  to the I MF under the Resilience 
and Sustainability Trust.

Defence Service Homes Insurance  Scheme  
The Defence Service Homes Insurance Scheme (DSH Insurance) was established in  1919 
under  the Defence  Service  Homes  Act 1918 . DSH Insurance  offers  personal  insurance  products 
to eligible serving Australian Defence Force members, veterans and widow(er)s. 
It underwrites  home  building  insurance  and offers  a range  of personal  insurance  products 
(such as contents and motor vehicle insurance) underwritten by QBE Insurance (Australia)  
Limited  (QBE) . 
DSH Insurance is funded by premiums collected from policy holders, commissions from 
QBE and returns on investments. Due to the nature of insurance, DSH Insurance ’s financial 
performance ca n be volatile from year to year. The last few years have been challenging 
for DSH Insurance due to increases in claims from extreme weather events (including 
bushfires, hailstorms and floods), combined with low investment returns and increased 
pricing on r einsurance premiums. These are industry -wide challenges affecting all 
general  insurers.  
DSH Insurance manages the volatility of the insurance cycle by aiming for an appropriate 
level of capital (that is, reserves) consistent with the regulations placed on insurers and 
monitored by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. DSH Insurance also has a 
comprehensive reinsurance program in place, reducing the exposure to loss by passing part 
of the risk of loss to a group of reinsurers. Nevertheless, there r emains a risk that additional 
Government contributions could be required should these reserves be insufficient to cover 
the liabilities of DSH Insurance.

Government loans  
Loans are recorded as financial assets. Accordingly, the amounts advanced and repa id do 
not normally affect the Budget aggregates of fiscal balance and underlying cash balance. 
Loans that are concessional (lower than market interest rate) or are agreed to be written off, 
result in an impact on the fiscal balance.  
The Government makes l oans for policy purposes. All loans contain some element of credit 
risk that they will not be repaid in full, although in many cases this risk is small. Table 9.3 
summarises Government loans estimated to exceed $200  million at 30 June  2024 .

Drought -related and farm finance concessional loans – Agriculture  
As at 30  June  2024, the fair value of farm business, drought and dairy farm related loans is 
estimated to total $ 164.6  million.  
Drought Recovery and Dairy Recovery Concessional Loans Scheme: The drought 
recovery component of this scheme provided loans to farm businesses affected by 
unprecedented drought or, where applicable, Queensland farm businesses directly 
impacted by the combined effects of drought and the mid -2011 disruption to live cattle 
exports to Indonesia. The loans funded planting and restocking activities and associated 
expenses when seasonal conditions allowed. The loans were available from  January  2015 
and, in 2014–15, operated in Queensland and New South Wales. In 2015 –16, drought 
recovery concessional loans were available in Queensland, New South Wales, South 
Australia and Tasmania . 
The dairy recovery component of this scheme provided concessional loans to dairy farm 
businesses affected by the 2016 reduction in farm gate milk prices by Murray Goulburn, 
Fonterra and National Dairy Products. Loans were available for debt r estructuring, 
providing new debt for operating expenses or productivity enhancement activities, or a 
combination of these purposes. Dairy recovery concessional loans became available in 
Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania from  June  2016 . Applications

six-monthly basis and revised in accordance with changes in the ten -year Australian  
Government  bond rate. Loans have a maximum term of ten years with interest -only 
payments required for the first five years. Principal and interest repayments will be made 
in the remaining five years of the loan term.  
Farm Business Concessional Loans Scheme: This scheme provided three types of 
concessional loans: drought assistance, dairy recovery and business improvemen t. This 
scheme was designed to cover a farmer ’s short -term needs when income was tight and to

to eligible farm businesses experiencing financial difficulties that were considered 
commercially viable in the long -term, and were for produc tivity enhancements and debt 
restructuring. Applications for Farm Finance Concessional Loans closed on 30  June  2015.  
Farm Investment Loans, Drought Loans, AgriStarter Loans, AgBiz Drought 
Loans and AgRebuild Loans  
The Regional Investment Corporation commen ced operations on 1  July 2018.  
There are three  loan products currently available to farm businesses:  Farm Investment

Clean Energy Finance Corporation  
The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) has developed a portfolio of loans and 
investments across the spectrum of clean energy technologies, as required by the 
Clean  Energy Finance Corporation Act 2012 and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation 
Investment Mandate Direction 2023  (the Investment Mandate), comprising the General 
Portfolio, Rewiring the Nation Fund and Specialised Investment Funds.  
The CEFC ’s loan port folio consists of predominantly senior -ranking secured loans, bonds 
and secured project finance facilities, typically secured against energy generating assets 
such as wind or solar farms or energy efficiency assets.  
The CEFC ’s Rewiring the Nation Fund is expected to deliver concessional finance, 
including loans, for projects that support grid transformation. This portfolio of loans is 
expected to be predominately comprised of unsecured corporate facilities, as well as senior 
ranking secured loans and se cured project finance facilities.  
The CEFC ’s Specialised Investment Funds portfolio of loans (consisting of the Clean Energy 
Innovation Fund, the Advancing Hydrogen Fund, the Powering Australia Technology 
Fund and the Household Energy Upgrades Fund) are ex pected to be predominantly 
unsecured corporate facilities, senior -ranking secured loans, bonds and secured project 
finance facilities.  
The targeted level of risk for each of these portfolios is set out in the Investment Mandate. 
For all but the Rewiring th e Nation Fund, the CEFC Board seeks to develop a portfolio of 
loans and investments that , in aggregate , has an acceptable but not excessive level of risk 
relative to the sector and the specific focus of each of the Funds. For the Rewiring the 
Nation Fund, the Board must seek to develop a portfolio that , in aggregate , has an 
acceptable level of risk relative to the sector and the focus of the Rewiring the Nation Fund.  
The Rewiring the Nation Fund investments may increase the CEFC ’s overall exposure to 
risk as the scale, concentration, loan tenor and nature of these investments will have a 
higher risk profile. The Specialised Investment Funds may also have a higher risk profile 
than the General Portfolio, however they are a relatively smaller component of the  CEFC’s 
overall exposure.  
The CEFC has predominantly made loans as a co -financier either jointly or in consortiums 
with private sector financial institutions. Interest rates vary with a current average expected 
return of approximately 4.5  per cent. Loans have various maturity dates, typically in the 
range of 5 to 15  years, although it is anticipated that loan tenors will extend with the 
introduction of the Rewiring the Nation Fund. As at 30  June  2024, loans contracted and 
outstanding are estimated to  total  $2.8 billion  and are almost exclusively in the General 
Portfolio.

Education  
Higher Education Loan  Program  
The Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) is an income -contingent loan program that 
assists eligible higher education students with the cost of their student contribution 
amounts and tuition fees. As at 30  June  2024, the fair value of HELP debt outstanding is 
estimated to be $4 3.2 billion . The fair value takes into account the concessionality  of HELP 
loans and makes an allowance for debt not expected to be repaid.  
Debts outstanding for more than 11 months are indexed annually . From 1 June 2023, 
subject to the passage of legislation, indexation will be based on  the lower of the 
Wage  Price Index  or the Consumer Price Index. The Australian Taxation Office collects 
repayment of these debts through the tax system. Repayment of debts commence when 
an individual debtor ’s income reaches the repayment threshold.  
There were 2,952,715 HELP debtors as at 3 0 June  2023. The repayment term of a HELP 
debt  can only be determined for people who have fully repaid their debt. As at the end of  
June  2023, the average time taken to repay HELP debts was 9.6 years.  
Employment and Workplace Relations  
Australian Apprentic eship Support Loans Program  
The Australian Apprenticeship Support Loans Program (formerly  Trade Support Loans 
Program ) is an income -contingent, concessional loan program that assists eligible 
Australian apprentices by providing financial support of up to $24,492 (for 2023 –24) to 
assist with the costs of living, learning and undertaking an apprenticeship, and helping 
apprentices to focu s on completing a qualification listed on the Australian Apprenticeships 
Priority List.  
An e ligible Australian Apprentice can access up to $816.41 per month in the first year of 
their apprenticeship, $612.31 per month in the second year, $408.20 per month in the third 
year, and $204.10 per month in the fourth year.  
The loan amounts provided are higher in the early years of training to compensate for 
lower wages. The lifetime limit of $24,492 was indexed on 1  July 2023 using the Consumer 
Price Index and will  continue to be indexed annually on 1  July to maintain its real value.  
As an incentive to encourage completion of training, apprentices who successfully 
complete their apprenticeships are eligible for a 20  per cent discount on their loan. The  
loans become repayable at the same thresholds as the Higher Education Loan Program, 
which is $51,550 for the 2023 –24 income year. This is a demand driven program. As at 
30 June  2024, the fair value of the Australian Apprenticeship Support Loans debt 
outstanding is esti mated to be $987.2  million.  The fair value takes into account the 
concessionality of Australian Apprenticeship Support L oans and makes an allowance for 
debt not expected to be repaid.

VET Student Loans Program  
The VET Student Loans (VSL) Program is an inco me contingent loan program that assists 
eligible tertiary education students with the cost of their fees when undertaking approved 
higher -level Vocational Education and Training (VET) courses (diploma and above).  
Debts outstanding for more than 11 months are indexed annually . From 1 June 2023, 
subject to the passage of legislation, indexation will be based on  the lower of Wage Price 
Index or Consumer Price Index. The  Australian Taxation Office collects repayment of these 
debts through the tax system . Repayment of debts commence s when an individual debtor ’s 
income reaches the repayment threshold. Debtors must pay Higher Education Loan 
Program (HELP) debts before they repay VSL debts.  
There were 129,357 VSL debtors as at 30  June  2023. The repayment te rm of a VSL debt can 
only be determined for people who have fully repaid their debt. There is insufficient data 
for post 1  July 2019 VSL to determine the average time to repay.  
Prior to the commencement of the VSL Program, loans for VET students were available 
through the VET -FEE HELP (VFH) scheme , which closed to new students on 
31 December  2016. As at 30  June  2024, the fair value of both VFH  debt and VSL debt 
outstanding is estimated to be $3.3  billion . The fair value takes into account the 
concessionality of VSL loans and makes an allowance for debt not expected to be repaid.  
To support students affected by the delayed transfer of historical VET loans, accessed 
under the former VFH scheme and the current VSL program, the Australian  Governmen t 
agreed to waive historical indexation for affected loans and the entirety of affected VFH 
debts for study prior to 2017.

Australia for Telstra ’s acquisition of Digicel Pacific. Telstra now owns and operates Digicel 
Pacific. This package includes debt and equity, such as secu rities designed to secure the 
Government a long -term return. It is estimated that by 30  June  2024, US$1.443  billion  
(around A$2. 029 billion ) in funds will have been drawn down.

National Reconstruction  Fund Corporation  
The National Reconstruction Fund Corporation Act 2023  (NRFC Act) commenced on 
18 September  2023 , establishing the National Reconstruction Fund Corporation (NRFC) to 
facilitate increased flows of finance into priority areas of the Australian economy . 
The NRFC off ers loans and guarantees and makes equity investments in priority areas of 
the economy consistent with the NRFC  Act and the associated instrument. The NRFC will 
make a range of investments, including in emerging technologies and technically complex 
projects that carry higher risk. There are also risks inherent in investing in a large and 
diverse portfolio of financial assets. In practice, this will involve some short -term volatility 
in the NRFC ’s returns, including the possibility of credit losses across the portfolio.  
While the NRFC has been  established in 2023 –24, the risk around revenue and loss 
projections are unqua ntifiable at this time.   
The NRFC Board develops the NRFC ’s investment portfolio with an appropriate risk 
tolerance relative to the National Reconstruction Fund priority areas as required by the 
National Reconstruction Fund Corporation (Investment Mandate)  Direction 2023  and the National 
Reconstruction Fund Corporation (Priority Areas) Declaration 2023 .

Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Loans  
The Northern Australia Infrast ructure Facility (NAIF) is a lending facility established by 
the Australian Government under the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Act 2016  and 
will continue to make investment decisions  until 30  June  2026. The primary purpose of the 
NAIF is to pr ovide loans or alternative financing mechanisms to infrastructure projects. 
The infrastructure that NAIF can finance is wide ranging and includes assets that facilitate 
the establishment or enhancement of business activity or increase economic activity in 
a region.  
To be eligible for a loan from the NAIF, including up to 100  per cent of the project ’s debt, 
project proponents must meet the mandatory criteria outlined in the NAIF Investment 
Mandate that commenced on  15 December  2023 . Since its establishment, the NAIF has been 
amended to:  
• expand the eligibility for NAIF financing to include non -construction activities 
associated with the development of economic infrastructure  
• provide NAIF with expanded debt tools, including the ability to provide letters of 
credit, guarantees and lend in foreign currency, finance smaller loans through working 
with financing partnerships, and  in certain circumstances provide financing directly to 
proponents rather than via the States or Northern Territory   
  |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 344  |  Statement 9: Statement of Risks  
• make equity investments subject to a cap of $50  million and a minimum of $5  million 
per investment, for non -controlling interest  
• enhance the potential to deliver significant public benefit to northern Australia by 
removing the prohibition against the Australian  Govern ment  assuming the majority 
risk in any project. The new requirement is that the financial risk be acceptable but 
not excessive  
• legislate the requirement to earmark $500  million of its $7  billion  appropriation to go 
towards realising the Government ’s Criti cal Minerals Strategy and create alignment of 
investment decisions to Government Policy Priorities  
• add further areas to be considered as part of NAIF ’s Risk Appetite Statement – 
including risk sharing between NAIF and the Australian  Government , climate cha nge 
related risks and net zero transition risks  
• extend NAIF ’s internal and external reporting on investments  
• further tighten NAIFs Direct Financing powers and a greater emphasis on 
consulting/collaborating with other Commonwealth entities/Specialist 
Invest ment  Vehicles.  
The Australian Government updated the Investment Mandate to give effect to these changes.  
WestConnex Stage 2 Concessional Loan  
The WestConnex concessional loan is a $2  billion  loan facility provided to deliver 
WestConnex Stage  2. The concessional loan enabled Stage 2 to be brought forward, 
allowing Stages 1 and 2 to proceed in parallel. This resulted in significant time savings 
compared to the original approach where these stag es progressed in sequence.   
WestConnex Stage 2 includes the King Georges Road Interchange Upgrade (completed in 
2016) and construction of new twin tunnels from Kingsgrove to a new St Peters 
interchange, providing motorway connections to Alexandria and Masc ot, the M4 -M5 Link 
(completed in  January  2023) and the future Sydney Gateway.  
The concessional loan agreement requires that the loan be repaid between  September  2029 
and July 2034.

Home Equity Access  Scheme  
The Home Equity Access Scheme (HEAS) is a voluntary arrangement which allows eligible 
older Australians to receive a non -taxable loan from the Australian  Government . The loan 
can be paid as regular fortnightly instalments or capped lump sum advance payments, or 
both, for people of Age Pension age who meet certain residency criteria and own suitable 
real estate in Australia.  
Any amount received under HEAS, and any in terest and costs accrued , is attributed as a 
debt against real estate assets provided as collateral by the participant. The loan can be paid 
back at any time or is recovered on the sale of the secured real estate or from the person ’s 
estate. Additionally, since 1  July 2022, a No Negative Equity Guarantee applies to HEAS 
loans, limiting the recoverable debt to the equity in the property used to secure the loan.   
Student Financial Supplement  Scheme  
The Student Financial Supplement Scheme (SFSS) commenced in  January  1993 and closed

maximum of twice a year and each SSL payment is valued at $1,273 (in 2024). The SSL is 
repayable under similar arrangements to Higher Ed ucation Loan Program (HELP) debts. 
Students are required to start repaying their SSL once they earn over $51,550 for 2023 –24,  
  |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 346  |  Statement 9: Statement of Risks  
and only after they have repaid any HELP and Vocational Education Training student loan 
debt. When it commenced, the SSL was initi ally for new student payment recipients 
undertaking higher education. From 1  July 2017, with the closure of the Student Start -up 
Scholarship, the SSL has become available to all eligible student payment recipients 
undertaking higher education.  
The estimate d fair value of the SSL is $8 39.3 million at 30  June  2024.

Statement 10: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements   |  Page 349 Statement  10: 
Australian Government Budget Financial 
Statements   
Consistent with the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998 (the Charter),  the Government has 
produced a set of financial statements for the Australian Government general government 
sector (GGS), the public non -financial corporations (PNFC) sector, the total non -financial 
public sector (NFPS) and the public financial corporation s (PFC) sector. The financial 
statements comply with both the Australian Bureau of Statistics ’ (ABS) accrual Government 
Finance Statistics (GFS) and Australian Accounting Standards (AAS), with departures 
disclosed. These statements are:  
• an operating statem ent, including other economic flows, which shows net operating 
balance and net lending/borrowing (fiscal balance)  
• a balance sheet, which shows net worth, net financial worth, net financial liabilities 
and net debt  
• a cash flow statement, which includes the calculation of the underlying cash balance.  
In addition to these general purpose statements, notes to the financial statements are 
required. These notes include a summary of accounting policies, disaggregated information 
and other disclosures required by A AS. 
The statements reflect the Government ’s policy that the ABS GFS remains the basis of 
budget accounting policy, except where AAS is applied because it provides a better 
conceptual basis for presenting information of relevance to users of public sector 
financial  reports.  
The Australian, state and territory governments have an agreed framework – the Uniform 
Presentation Framework (UPF) – for the presentation of government financial information 
on a basis broadly consistent with  the Australian Accounting Standard AASB  1049. 
The financial statements are consistent with the requirements of the UP F.

Notes to the  general government sector financial statements  
Note  1: External reporting standards and accounting policies  
The Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998  (the Charter) requires that the Budget be based on 
external reporting standards and that departures from app licable external reporting 
standards be identified.  
The external standards used for budget reporting purposes are:  
• the Australian Bureau of Statistics ’ (ABS) accrual Government Finance Statistics (GFS) 
publication, Australian System of Government Finance Statistics: Concepts, Sources and 
Methods, 2015  (cat. no. 5514.0), which is based on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
accrual GFS framework  
• the Aus tralian Accounting Standards (AAS), issued by the Australian Accounting 
Standards Board (AASB), which includes International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted in Australia for use by the not -for-profit sector and specific standards such as 
AASB  1049  Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting  
(AASB  1049).  
The financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis that complies with both 
the ABS GFS and AAS, except for departures disclosed at Note  2. A more detailed 
desc ription of the AAS and the ABS GFS frameworks, in addition to definitions of key 
terms used in these frameworks, can be found in Appendix A. Detailed accounting policies, 
as well as a set of notes and other disclosures as required by AAS, are disclosed in the 
Australian Government Consolidated Financial Statements.  
Fiscal reporting focuses on the general government sector (GGS). The GGS provides public 
services that are mainly non -market in nature and for the collective consumption of the 
community, or invo lve the transfer or redistribution of income. These services are largely 
financed through taxes and other compulsory levies. This sector comprises all government 
departments, offices and some other bodies. In preparing financial statements for the GGS, 
all material transactions and balances between entities within the GGS have been 
eliminated.  
The Government ’s key fiscal aggregates are based on the ABS GFS concepts and 
definitions, including the ABS GFS cash surplus/deficit and net financial worth. 
AASB  1049 requires the disclosure of other ABS GFS fiscal aggregates, including the net 
operating balance, net lending/borrowing (fiscal balance) and net worth. In addition to 
these ABS GFS aggregates, the Uniform Presentation Framework (UPF) requires disclosure 
of net debt, net financial worth and net financial liabilities.  
AASB  1049 and the UPF also provide a basis for reporting the public non -financial 
corporations (PNFC) and public financial corporations (PFC) sectors and the total 
non-financial public sector ( NFPS).   
  |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 370  |  Statement 10: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  
AASB  1049 requires disaggregated information, by ABS GFS function, for expenses and 
total assets to be disclosed where they are reliably attributable. The ABS GFS does not 
require total assets to be attributed to functions. In accordance with the AB S GFS, 
disaggregated information for expenses and net acquisition of non -financial assets by 
function is disclosed in Statement 6: Expenses and Net Capital Investment . In accordance with 
the UPF, purchases of non -financial assets by function are also discl osed in Statement 6 . 
AASB  1055 Budgetary Reporting  requires major variances between original budget estimates 
and outcomes to be explained in the financial statements. Explanations of variances in fiscal 
balance, revenue, expenses, net capital investment, cash flows, net debt, net financial worth 
and net worth since the 2023–24 Budget  are disclosed in the Statement 3:  Fiscal Strategy and 
Outlook , with decisions taken since the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2023 –24 
(MYEFO) disclosed in Budget Paper No . 2 Budget Measures 202 4–25. All policy decisions 
taken between the 202 3–24 Budget and the 202 3–24 MYEFO  are disclosed in Appendix A of 
MYEFO.  
Details of the Australian Government ’s GGS contingent liabilities are disclosed in 
Statement  9: Statement  of Risks.  
Note  2: Departures from external reporting standards  
The Charter requires that departures from applicable external reporting standards be 
identified. The major differences betwe en AAS and the ABS GFS treatments of transactions 
are outlined in Table  10.13. 
AASB  1049 requires AAS measurement of items to be disclosed on the face of the financial 
statements with reconciliation to the ABS GFS measurement of key fiscal aggregates, wher e 
different, in notes to the financial statements. Only one measure of each aggregate has been 
included on the face statements to avoid confusion.  
Further information on the differences between the two systems is provided in the ABS 
publication  Australian System of Government Finance Statistics: Concepts, Sources and Methods, 
2015  (cat. no. 5514.0).

Table  10.13: Major differences between AAS and ABS GFS  
Issue  AAS treatment  ABS GFS treatment  Treatment 
adopted  
Circulating coins – 
seigniorage  The profit between the cost 
and sale of circulating coins 
(seigniorage) is treated as 
revenue.  Circulating coins is treated as 
a liability, and the cost of 
producing the coins is treated 
as an expense.  AAS 
Valuation of loans  Changes in the valuation of 
loans are treated as a revenue 
or an expense.  
In some circumstances 
recognition as a revenue or an 
expense is delayed until the 
loan ends or is transferred.  Changes in the valuation of 
loans (excluding mutually 
agreed write -downs) are 
treated as an ‘other 
economic  flow’. ABS GFS  
Timing recognition 
of Boosting Cash 
Flow for Employers  Expense recognition is based 
on underlying economic 
activity that gives rise to the 
Cash Flow Boost payment.  Recognised when the 
businesses receive payments 
after submitting their activity 
statements and having met all 
requirements.  AAS 
Leases  AASB  16 introduced a single 
lease accounting framework 
for lessees, which replaced the 
distinction between operating 
and finance leases. Right of 
use assets and lease liabilities 
are re cognised on the balance 
sheets for leases that were 
previously accounted for as 
operating expense.  The distinction between 
operating leases and finance 
leases is continued for 
lessees.  AAS 
Concessional loans  Concessional elements are 
treated as an expense on initial 
recognition and unwound over 
the loan term.  Concessional elements are 
treated as an ‘other economic 
flow’. AAS 
Investment in other 
public sector 
entities  Valued at fair value in the 
balance sheet as long as it can 
be reliably measured, 
otherwise net assets is 
permissible.  Unlisted entities are valued 
based on their net assets in 
the balance sheet.  AAS 
Provision for 
restoration, 
decommissioning 
and make -good  Capitalised when the asset is 
acquired.  Capitalised when make -good 
activity take s place.  AAS 
Renewable Energy 
Certificates (RECs)  The issuance and registration 
of RECs is considered to be an 
administrative function and 
does not result in the 
recognition of assets or 
liabilities and, consequently, no 
revenue or expenses are 
recognised.  The issuance and registration 
of RECs is considered to be 
government financial 
transactions resulting in the 
recognition of assets, liabilities, 
revenue and expenses.  AAS 
Dividends paid by 
public corporations  Treated as an equity 
distribution.  Equity distributions 
are treated as a distribution of 
profits, as opposed to an 
expense.  Dividends are treated as 
an expense.  ABS GFS

Dividends paid by 
the Reserve Bank 
of Australia  Dividends are recognised in 
the year profit was earned.  Dividends are recognised 
when the Treasurer makes a 
determination.  AAS 
National Disability 
Insurance Scheme 
(NDIS) revenue  Funding contributions by the 
state and territory governments 
to NDIS are treated as sales of 
goods and services revenue.  
In-kind disability services 
provided by the state and 
territory governments are 
treated as other revenue.  Funding contributions by the 
state and territory governments 
to NDIS are treated as grants 
revenue.  
In-kind disability services 
provided by the state and 
territory governments are 
treated as sales of goods and 
services revenue.  AAS 
Commercial tax 
effect accounting 
assets and 
liabilities  Corporations in the PNFC and 
PFC sectors record tax 
expenses on a commercial 
basis.  Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are reversed so that 
corporations record tax 
expenses on a consistent 
basis to the Australian 
Taxation Office.  ABS GFS  
Timing recognition 
of vaccine expense  Recognised when vaccines are 
delivered to the states and 
territories.  Recognised when the vaccine 
doses are administered. 
Vaccine wastage after 
distributions are recognised a s 
an ‘other economic flow ’. AAS 
Regional 
Broadband 
Scheme  The revenue from the levy on 
internet service providers 
(ISPs) and the associated 
subsidy expense to NBN Co 
for the provision of regional 
broadband services are 
recorded separately on a gross 
basis.  The revenue from the levy on 
ISPs and the associated 
subsidy expense to NBN Co 
are recorded on a net basis.  AAS 
Fiscal aggregates differences  
Net worth of PNFC 
and PFC sectors  Calculated as assets less 
liabilities.  Calculated as assets less 
liabilities less shares and other 
contributed capital.  AAS 
Net financial worth 
of PNFC and PFC

Appendix A: Financial reporting standards 
and budget concepts  
The Budget primarily focuses on the financial performance and position of the general 
government sector (GGS). The GGS provides public services that are mainly non -market in 
nature and for the collective consumption of the community, or involve the transfer or 
redistribution of income. These services are largely financed through tax es and other 
compulsory levies. AASB  1049 recognises the GGS as a reporting entity.  
AASB  1049 Conceptual framework  
AASB  1049 seeks to ‘harmonise ’ the ABS GFS and AAS.  
The reporting framework for AASB  1049 requires the preparation of accrual -based general 
purpose financial reports, showing government assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and 
cash flows. GGS reporting under AASB  1049 aims to provide users with information about 
the stewardship of each government in relation to its GGS and acco untability for the 
resources entrusted to it; information about the financial position, performance and cash 
flows of each government ’s GGS; and information that facilitates assessments of the 
macroeconomic impact. AASB  1049 also provides a basis for whole -of-government 
reporting, including for the PNFC and PFC sectors.  
AASB  1049 has adopted the AAS conceptual framework and principles for the recognition 
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and their presentation, measurement and 
disclosure. In add ition, AASB  1049 has broadly adopted the ABS GFS conceptual 
framework for presenting government financial statements. In particular, AASB  1049 
requires the GGS to prepare a separate set of financial statements, overriding AASB  10 
Consolidated Financial Sta tements . AASB  1049 also follows the ABS GFS by requiring changes 
in net worth to be split into either transactions or ‘other economic flows ’ and for this to be 
presented in a single operating statement. AASB  1049 is therefore broadly consistent with 
intern ational statistical standards and the International Monetary Fund ’s (IMF) Government 
Finance Statistics Manual 2014 .41 
  
— 
41  Additional information on the Australian accrual GFS framework is available in the ABS 
publication Australian System of Government Finance Statistics: Concepts, Sources and 
Methods,  2015  (cat. no. 5514.0).   
  |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 386  |  Statement 10: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  
All financial data presented in the financial statements are recorded as either stocks 
(assets  and liabilities) or flows (classified as either transactions or ‘other economic flows ’). 
Transactions result from a mutually agreed interaction between economic entities. 
Despite  their compulsory nature, taxes are transactions deemed to occur by mutual 
agreement between the government and the taxpayer. Transactions that increase or 
decrease net worth (assets less liabilities) are reported as revenues and expenses 
respectively in the operating statement.42 
A change to the value or volume of an asset or liabi lity that does not result from a 
transaction is an ‘other economic flow ’. This can include changes in values from market 
prices, most actuarial valuations and exchange rates, and changes in volumes from 
discoveries, depletion and destruction. All ‘other ec onomic flows ’ are reported in the 
operating statement.  
Consistent with the ABS GFS framework, and in general AAS, the financial statements 
record flows in the period in which they occur. As a result, prior period outcomes may be 
revised for classification changes relating to information that could reasonably have been 
expected to be known in the past, is material in at least one of the affected periods and can 
be reliably assigned to the relevant period(s).  
Operating statement  
The operating statement presen ts details of transactions in revenues, expenses, the net 
acquisition of non -financial assets (net capital investment) and other economic flows for an 
accounting period.  
Revenues arise from transactions that increase net worth and expenses arise from 
trans actions that decrease net worth. Revenues less expenses gives the net operating 
balance. The net operating balance is similar to the National Accounts concept of 
government saving plus capital transfers.  
The net acquisition of non -financial assets (net cap ital investment) equals gross fixed capital 
formation, less depreciation, plus changes (investment) in inventories, plus other 
transactions in non -financial assets.  
‘Other economic flows ’ are presented in the operating statement and outline changes in net 
worth that are driven by economic flows other than revenues and expenses. Revenues, 
expenses and ‘other economic flows ’ sum to the total change in net worth during a period. 
The majority of ‘other economic flows ’ for the Australian  Government  GGS arise fro m price 
movements in its assets and liabilities.  
— 
42 Not all transactions impact net worth. For examp le, transactions in financial assets and 
liabilities do not impact net worth as they represent the swapping of assets and liabilities 
on the balance sheet.   
Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 10: Australian Govern ment Budget Financial Statements   |  Page 387 
Net operating balance  
The net operating balance is the excess of revenue from transactions over expenses from 
transactions. The net operating balance excludes expenditure on the acquisition of capital 
assets but includes non -cash costs such as accruing superannuation entitlements and the 
consumption of capital (depreciation). By including all accruing costs, including 
depreciation, the net operating balance encompasses the full current cost of providing  
government services. This makes it a measure of the sustainability of the government ’s 
fiscal position over time and provides an indication of the sustainability of the existing level 
of government services.  
Fiscal balance  
The fiscal balance (or net lendi ng/borrowing) is the net operating balance less net capital 
investment. The fiscal balance includes the impact of net expenditure (effectively purchases 
less sales) on non -financial assets rather than consumption (depreciation) of non -financial 
assets.43 
The fiscal balance measures the Australian Government ’s investment -saving balance. 
It measures in accrual terms the gap between government savings plus net capital transfers 
and investment in non -financial assets. As such, it approximates the contribution o f the 
Australian Government GGS to the balance on the current account in the balance of 
payments.  
Balance sheet  
The balance sheet shows stocks of assets, liabilities and net worth. In accordance with the 
UPF, net debt, net financial worth and net financial  liabilities are also reported in the 
balance sheet.  
Net worth  
The net worth of the GGS, PNFC and PFC sectors is defined as assets less liabilities. 
This  differs from the ABS GFS definition for the PNFC and PFC sectors where net worth is 
defined as assets less liabilities less shares and other contributed capital. Net  worth is an 
economic measure of wealth, reflecting the Australian Government ’s contribution to the 
wealth of Australia.  
  
— 
43  The net operating  balance includes consumption of non -financial assets because depreciation 
is an  expense. Depreciation  is deducted in the calculation  of net capital investment as the full 
investment in non -financial assets is included in the calculation of fiscal balance.   
  |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 388  |  Statement 10: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  
Net financial worth  
Net financial worth measures a government ’s net ho ldings of financial assets. It is 
calculated from the balance sheet as financial assets minus liabilities. This differs from the 
ABS GFS definition of net financial worth for the PNFC and PFC sectors, defined as 
financial assets, less liabilities, less sha res and other contributed capital. Net financial worth 
is a broader measure than net debt, in that it incorporates provisions made (such as 
superannuation) as well as equity holdings. Net financial worth includes all classes of 
financial assets and all lia bilities, only some of which are included in net debt. 
As non-financial assets are excluded from net financial worth, this is a narrower measure 
than net worth. However, it avoids the concerns inherent with the net worth measure 
relating to the valuation o f non -financial assets and their availability to offset liabilities.  
Net financial liabilities  
Net financial liabilities comprises total liabilities less financial assets but excludes equity 
investments in the other sectors of the jurisdiction. Net financi al liabilities is a more 
accurate indicator than net debt of a jurisdiction ’s fiscal position as it includes substantial 
non-debt liabilities such as accrued superannuation and long service leave entitlements. 
Excluding the net worth of other sectors of go vernment results in a purer measure of 
financial worth than net financial worth as, in general, the net worth of other sectors of 
government, in particular the PNFC sector, is backed by physical assets.  
Net debt  
Net debt is the sum of interest bearing liab ilities less the sum of selected financial assets 
(cash and deposits, advances paid and investments, loans and placements). Financial assets 
include the Future Fund ’s investments in interest bearing securities and collective 
investment vehicles (CIVs). CIV s enable investors to pool their money and invest the 
pooled funds, rather than buying securities directly.  Net debt does not include 
superannuation related liabilities. Net debt is a common measure of the strength of a 
government ’s financial position. Hig h levels of net debt impose a call on future revenue 
flows to service that debt.  
The 2015 ABS GFS Manual presents debt in a matrix format, with no single net debt 
aggregate identified. The Australian Government continues to report net debt in 
accordance wi th the UPF as described above.

Statement 10: Australian Govern ment Budget Financial Statements   |  Page 389 
Cash flow statement  
The cash flow statement identifies how cash is generated and applied in a single accounting 
period. The cash flow statement reflects a cash basis of recording (rather than an accrual 
basis) where information is derived indirectly from underlying accrual transactions and 
movements in balances. This, in effect, means that transactions are captured when cash is 
received or when cash payments are made. Cash transactions are specifically identified 
beca use cash management is considered an integral function of accrual budgeting.  
Underlying cash balance  
The underlying cash balance is the cash counterpart of the fiscal balance, reflecting the 
Australian Government ’s cash investment -saving balance.  
For the G GS, the underlying cash balance is calculated as shown below:  
Net cash flows from operating activities  
plus 
Net cash flows from investments in non -financial assets  
equals  
ABS GFS cash surplus/deficit  
plus 
Principal payments of lease liabilities  
equals  
Unde rlying cash balance  
Under the Future Fund Act 2006,  earnings are required to be reinvested to meet the 
Government ’s future public sector superannuation liabilities.  The Government excluded 
net Future Fund cash earnings from the calculation of the underlyin g cash balance between 
2005–06 and 2019 –20. From 2020 –21 onwards, net Future Fund cash earnings have been 
included in the calculation of the underlying cash balance because the Future  Fund became 
available to meet the Government ’s superannuation liabilitie s from this year.  
In contrast, net Future Fund earnings have been included in the net operating balance and 
fiscal balance for all years because superannuation expenses relating to future cash 
payments are recorded in the net operating balance and fiscal b alance.  
Net Future Fund earnings are separately identified in the historical tables in Statement  11: 
Historical Australian Government Data.   
  |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 390  |  Statement 10: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  
Headline cash balance  
The headline cash balance is calculated by adding net cash flows from investments in 
financial assets for policy purposes to the underlying cash balance.  
Net cash flows from investments in financial assets for policy purposes include equity 
transactions and advances paid. Equity transactions include equity injections into 
controlled busine sses and privatisations of government businesses. Advances paid include 
net loans to the states and net loans to students.  
Sectoral classifications  
To assist in analysing the public sector, data are presented by institutional sector as shown 
in Figure  A10.1. The ABS GFS defines the GGS, PNFC and PFC sectors. AASB  1049 has also 
adopted this sectoral reporting.

• investments held in relation to the Australian Government Investment Funds, such as 
shares, which are expected to increase steadily over the forward estimates due to 
additional con tributions from Government and expected investment returns over time.  
Government Business Enterprises  
Government Business Enterprises (GBEs) represent a significant proportion of equity 
investments held by the Australian Government.  
These are commercially -focused government owned businesses that are established to fulfil 
an Australian Government purpose. They make a substantial contribution to  the Australian 
economy by supporting productivity, job creation and Government policy objectives.

Page 402  |  Statement 10: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  
Clean Energy Finance Corporation  
The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) was established as a Commonwealth 
Authority in August 2012 through the Clean Energy  Finance Corporation Act 2012  
(CEFC  Act).  
Under the CEFC Act, the CEFC has been provided $10.0 billion to invest in renewable 
energy, low emissions technology and energy efficiency projects.  
The Government has also provided CEFC with an additional $20.5 billion to support the 
Government ’s policy priorities . This comprises  $19 billion for rewiring the nation, to 
expand and modernise Australia ’s electricity grids and $500.0  million, (to combine with 
$500.0  million from the private sector ), to establish a $1.0  billion Powering Australia 
Technology Fund. It also includes $1.0 billion to support household energy efficiency 
upgrades.  
The CEFC continues to invest funds and manage its investments. Investment decisions are 
made by an independent board consistent with the CEFC Act and the CEFC ’s investment 
mandate.  
National Reconstruction Fund Corporation  
The National Reconstruction Fund Corporation (NRFC) was established as a corporate 
Commonwealth entity by the National Reconstruction Fund Corporation Act 2023  (NRFC A ct) 
to support, diversify and transform Australian industry and the economy.  
The NRFC will make $15.0  billion of targeted co -investments through independently

increasing to $ 245.7 billion by 30 June 2028.   
Non -financial assets comprise assets such as land, buildings and property, plant and 
equipment and right -of-use lease assets. Non -financial assets are expected to grow 
consistently over the forward estimates predominantly due to increased investments in 
Specialis ed Military Equipment .  Budget Paper No. 1   |

Australian Government liabilities over the forward estimates  
The budgeted composition of liabilities on the Australian Government ’s balance sheet is 
provided in Chart 1 0B.5 below . 
Chart 1 0B.5: Composition of Australian Government liabilities over the forward 
estimates  
 
Note:  Other interest bearin g liabilities includes deposits held, loans and lease liabilities. Other provisions 
and payables includes other employee liabilities, suppliers payable, personal benefits payable, 
subsidies payable, grants payable, other payables and provisions.  
 
Total lia bilities are expected to grow consistently over the forward estimates, which is 
predominantly due to growth in government securities on issue and  superannuation  
liabilities.  
Government securities  
Government securities on the Australian Government ’s balance sheet reflect the market 
value of the Australian Government securities on issue, consistent with external reporting 
standards. Further detail on the face value of Australian Government securities  can be 
found in Statement 7: Debt Statement .  
Public sector employee superannuation liabilities  
Public sector employee superannuation entitlements relating to past and present civilian 
employees and military personnel are a financial liability on the Gove rnment ’s balance 
sheet. Total superannuation liabilities are projected to be $294. 7 billion  at 30  June 2024, 
$332.7 billion  at 30 June 2028 and approximately $506.2 billion at 30 June 2060 . 
Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
 
Statement 10: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements   |  Page 405 
These liabilities represent the present value of future unfunded s uperannuation benefits 
relating to past and present employees and are based on an actuarially determined 
discount rate. The long -term nature of the unfunded superannuation liabilities requires the 
use of a discount rate that best matches the duration of the liabilities. The use of a long -term 
discount rate for budget purposes avoids the volatility that would occur by using current 
market yields on Government bonds. The value recorded on the balance sheet is highly 
sensitive to the discount rat e used.  
In preparing the latest Long Term Cost Reports for the civilian and military schemes, the 
scheme actuaries determined that a discount rate of 5.0  per cent should be applied.  
The Australian Government has never fully funded its defined benefit schem e 
superannuation liabilities. However, the Future Fund was established in 2006 to help 
finance the Government ’s unfunded superannuation liabilities.  
For civilian employees, the major defined benefit schemes are the Commonwealth 
Superannuation Scheme and th e Public Sector Superannuation Scheme. These schemes 
were closed to new members in 1990 and 2005 respectively. The Public Sector 
Superannuation Accumulation Plan was introduced on 1 July 2005 and provides fully 
funded accumulation benefits for new civilian  employees from that date.  
For military personnel, the defined benefit schemes are the Defence Force Retirement and 
Death Benefits Scheme, the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Scheme and the Military 
Superannuation and Benefits Scheme (MSBS). Following t he closure of the MSBS on 
30 June  2016, all defined benefit military schemes are now closed to new members. A new 
military superannuation accumulation scheme, Australian Defence Force (ADF) Super, 
commenced on 1  July 2016. ADF Super is accompanied by a sta tutory death and disability 
arrangement ADF cover.  
While there have not been any new members to the public service and military defined 
benefit schemes since closure in 2005 and 2016 respectively, the Government ’s unfunded 
superannuation liabilities are ex pected to grow as current members continue to accrue 
benefits prior to retirement . Consistent with the 2020 Long -Term Cost Reports, the  
unfunded liability for public service defined benefit schemes is projected to peak in the mid 
2030’s, whilst the unfund ed liability for military defined benefit schemes is projected to 
continue to increase over time to 2060. The present value of the superannuation liability is 
also sensitive to changes in the discount  rate.  
As the superannuation liabilities are included in  the Government ’s net worth and 
net financial worth aggregates, revaluations of the liabilities have an impact on 
these  aggregates.

Government Dat a 
Statement  11 reports historical data for the Australian Government fiscal aggregates across 
the general government, public non -financial corporations and non -financial public sectors.  
Data sources  
Data are sourced from Australian Government Final Budget Outcomes , the 
Australian  Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the Australian  Office of Financial Management and 
Australian  Government Consolidated  Financial Statements . 
• Accrual data from  1996–97 onwards and cash data, net debt data, net financial worth 
data and net  worth data from  1999–2000 onwards are sourced from 
Australian  Government Final Budget Outcomes . Back -casting adjustments for accounting 
classification changes and other revisions have been made from  1998–99 onwards where 
applicable.  
• Cash data prior to  1999–2000 are sourced from ABS data, which have been calculated 
using methodology consistent with that used for later years in 
ABS  cat. no. 5512.0  Government Finance Statistics . 
• Net debt data prior to  1999–2000 are from ABS  cat. no. 5512.0 Government Finan ce 
Statistics  2003–04 in 1998–99, ABS  cat. no. 5501.0 Government Financial Estimates  
1999–2000  and ABS  cat. no. 5513.0 Public Sector Financial Assets and Liabilities  1998  from 
1987–88 to 1997–98, and Treasury estimates (see Treasury ’s Economic Roundup, 
Spring 1996 , pages 97 –103) prior to  1987–88. 
Comparability of data across years  
The data set contains a number of structural breaks owing to accounting classification 
differences and changes to the structure of the budget which cannot be eliminated through 
back-casting because of data limitations. These breaks can affect the comparability of data 
across years, especially when the analysis is taken over a large number of years. Specific 
factors causing structural breaks include:  
• Most recent accounting classifi cation changes that require revisions to the historical 
series have been back -cast (where applicable) to  1998–99, ensuring that data are 
consistent across the accrual period from  1998–99 onwards. However, because of data 
limitations, these changes have not  been back -cast to earlier years.  
• From  2019–20 onwards, as a result of the implementation of the accounting standard 
AASB  16 Leases , the distinction between operating and finance leases for lessees has 
been removed. This change impacted a number of budget aggregates, in particular net 
debt and net financial worth. Due to data limitations, these changes have not been 
back -cast to earlier years.    |  Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 412  |  Statement 11: Historical Australian G overnment Data  
• From  2005–06 onwards, underlying Government Finance Statistics (GFS) data are 
provided by agencies in accordance wi th Australian Accounting Standards (AAS), 
which include International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted in 
Australia. Prior to  2005–06, underlying GFS data are based on data provided by 
agencies applying AAS prior to the adoption of IFRS.  
• Prior to  1999–2000, Australian Government general government sector debt instruments 
are valued at historic cost, whereas from  1999–2000 onwards they are valued at market 
prices (consistent with accrual GFS standards). This affects net debt and net interest 
payments.  
• Cash data up to and including  1997–98 are calculated under a cash accounting 
framework, while cash data from  1998–99 onwards are derived from an accrual 
accounting framework.44 Although the major methodological differences associated 
with the move  to the accrual framework have been eliminated through back -casting, 
comparisons across the break may still be affected by changes to some data sources and 
collection methodologies.  
• Adjustments in the coverage of agencies are included in the accounts of th e different 
sectors. These include the reclassification of Central Banking Authorities from the 
general government to the public financial corporations sector in  1998–99, and 
subsequent back -casting to account for this change.  
• Changes have been made in arr angements for transfer payments, where tax concessions 
or rebates are replaced by payments through the social security system. This has the 
effect of increasing both cash receipts and payments, as compared with earlier periods, 
but not changing cash balanc es. Changes in the opposite direction reduce both cash 
payments and receipts.  
• Classification differences in the data relating to the period prior to  1976–77 mean that 
earlier data may not be entirely consistent with data for  1976–77 onwards.  
  
— 
44 Prior to the 2008 –09 Budget, cash data calculated under the cash accounting framework were 
used up to and including  1998–99. In the 2008 –09 Budget, cash data prior to  1998–99 have 
been replaced by ABS data derived from the accrual framework.  Budget Paper No. 1   |   
 
Statement 11: Historical Australian Government Data   |  Page 413 
Revisions to  previously published data  
Under the accrual GFS framework and generally under AAS, flows are recorded in the 
period in which they occurred. As a result, prior period outcomes may be revised for 
classification changes relating to information that could rea sonably have been expected to 
be known in the past, is material in at least one of the affected periods, and can be reliably 
assigned to the relevant period(s).  
There have been no material classification changes that have resulted in back -casting in this 
update.

The Government will provide $1.0  million over four years from 2024 –25 (and $0.3  million 
per year ongoing) to the Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA) to ensure  compliance 
with and enforcement of recent amendments to the National Vocational  Education and 
Training Regulator Act 2011  (NVETR Act). The amendments give  effect to measures that 
respond to integrity risks in the vocational education and  training sector an d improve 
ASQA’s practices and processes.   
The amendments have increased the financial penalties that will apply to a relevant  offence 
or civil penalty provision within the NVETR Act . This measure is estimated to  increase 
receipts by $3.0  million over four  years from 2024 –25.  Home Affairs   |

The Government will permanently abolish 457 nuisance tariffs from 1  July 2024, in the  
largest unilateral tariff reform in two decades.   
This measure will permanently set to ‘free’ the rate of duty in Schedule 3 and Schedules 4A 
to 15 inclusive of the Customs Tariff Act 1995  on 457 tariffs, streamlining the importation of 
$8.5 billion worth of goods annually.  
Abolishing nuisance tariffs su pports the Government’s Simplified Trade System agenda, 
will boost productivity, facilitate legitimate trade, and reduce compliance costs. These 
tariffs do nothing to protect domestic industry as goods imported under these tariffs are 
already largely eligi ble for existing tariff preferences or concessions.  
This measure will eliminate tariffs on a wide range of imported goods including 
toothbrushes, hand tools, fridges, dishwashers, clothing, and menstrual and 
sanitary  products.  
This measure is estimated t o decrease receipts by $41 .0 million over the 5  years from  
2023 –24.

MATES will provide a new mobility pathway for 3,000 Indian graduates and early career 
professionals (aged 18 to 30  years at the time of application), with knowledge and skills in 
targeted fields of study to live and work in Australia for up to two years. The visa will have 
a pre -application (ballot) charge of $25 and an application charge of $365, both of which 
will be indexed to the consumer price index in future years. This measure is part of the 
Australia -India Migration and Mobility Partnership Arrangement (MMPA).  
As part of the MMPA, the Government also lengthened the validity of the Visitor visa  
(subclass 600) Business Visitor stream for Indian nationals from up to three years to  up to 
five years.   
This measure is estimated to increase receipts by $435.0  million and increase  payments by 
$70.9  million over the 5  years from 2023 –24.

185,000 places and allocate 132,200 places (around 70 per cent) to the Skill stream. From 
2025 –26, the Government will extend the planning horizon for the permanent Migration  
Program from one year to four years.  
Maintaining around 70 per cent of places for the Skill stream will help address Australia’s 
long -term skill needs. Extending the planning horizon for the permanent Migration Program 
from one year to four years will en able better cross -government planning in the future.  
This measure is estimated to decrease receipts by $70.0  million and decrease  payments by 
$102.7  million over the 5  years from 2023 –24.  Home Affairs   |

to Ukraine, and commitment to supporting Ukraine’s continued participation in 
international trade and the efforts of Ukraine to uphold its territorial integrity.

website under the consultation page Miscellaneous Amendments to Treasury Portfolio 
Laws 2024.   
• Amend the start date of the 2023 –24 Budget measure Tax Integrity – expanding the genera l 
anti-avoidance rule in the income tax law  from income years commencing on or after 
1 July 2024 to income years commencing on or after the day the amending legislation

with the requirement for the Australian Taxation Office ( ATO ) to publish on its website 
a public register of excise licences and excise equivalent warehouse licences applying 
from 30 days following commencement of legislation. In addition, the removal of 
regulatory barriers applying to bunker fuels for commercial shipping industries will 
apply from 1  January  2025, instead of 1  July 2024.   Treasury   |   
 
 
 
Part 1: Receipt Measures  |  Page 11 
• Extend refunds of indirect tax (including  GST, fuel and alcohol taxes) under the Indirect 
Tax Concession Scheme (ITCS). The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will 
have ITCS access upgraded for additional concessions to be claimed for the purchase of 
vehicles for personal use by SKAO offic ials, or a member of their family. Additional 
concessions for commercial rent will also be formalised for existing ITCS packages for 
Bangladesh, Costa Rica, El Salvador and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office. 
Construction and renovation concessions wi ll be formalised for the existing ITCS 
package for the Netherlands. Concessions for both commercial rent and construction 
and renovation will be formalised for the existing ITCS  package for Pacific Trade Invest.   
• No longer proceed with the 2019 –20 Budget measure announced by the former 
Government Black Economy – Strengthening the Australian Business Number system as 
integrity issues are being addressed through enhanced administrative processes 
implemented by the ATO .  
• Further to the measure Rugby Wo rld Cup 2027 (men’s) and Rugby World Cup 2029 
(women’s)  announced in the 2022 –23 March Budget, the Government will provide 
income tax exemptions to World Rugby and/or related entities for income derived in 
relation to the Rugby World Cup 2027 (men’s) and R ugby World Cup 2029 (women’s) 
events (‘RWC events’). The exemptions will apply to income derived in relation to the 
RWC events for the 2023 –24 to 2030 –31 income years (inclusive). The Government will 
also provide an exemption from interest, dividend and ro yalty withholding tax 
liabilities arising from payments relating to RWC events.   
• Make changes to the agricultural levy and charge on sweet potatoes at the request of 
Australian Sweet potato Growers Inc. From 1  July 2024, the Government will decrease 
the mar keting component of the levy and charge from 1.0 per cent of sale value to nil. 
This change will decrease the overall levy rate on sweet potatoes from 1.5 per cent to 
0.5 per cent.   
• Amend the 2022 –23 October Budget measure Multinational Tax Integrity Packa ge – 
amending Australia’s interest limitation (thin capitalisation) rules  to exempt Australian 
plantation forestry entities from the new earnings -based rules, allowing these entities to 
continue to apply the former asset -based thin capitalisation rules.   
• Discontinue the measure Denying deductions for payments relating to intangibles held in 
low- or no -tax jurisdictions  announced in the 2022 –23 October Budget as the integrity 
issues will now be addressed through the Global Minimum Tax and Domestic 
Minimum Ta x being implemented by the Government. The Government will also 
introduce a new provision from 1  July 2026 that applies a penalty to taxpayers who are 
part of a group with more than $1 billion in global turnover annually that are found to 
have mischaracter ised or undervalued royalty payments, to which royalty withholding 
tax would otherwise apply.    
  |  Budget Paper No. 2

• Amend the tax law to give the Commissioner of Taxation (Commissioner) a discretion 
to not use a taxpayer’s refund to offset old tax debts, where the Commissioner  had put 
that old tax debt on hold prior to 1  January  2017. This discretion will apply to 
individuals, small businesses and not -for-profits, and will maintain the Commissioner’s 
current administrative approach.   
These changes will decrease receipts by $158.7  million and increase payments by  
$122.3  million over the 5 years from 2023 –24.

The Government has increased the Medicare levy low -income thresholds for singles, 
families, and seniors and pensioners from 1  July 2023 to provide cost -of-living relief. The 
increase to the thresholds ensures that low income individuals continue to be exempt from 
paying the Medicare levy or pay a reduced levy rate.  
The increase to the thresholds accounts for recent annual CPI outcomes and is estimated to 
decrease receipts by $640  million over the four years to 2026 –27.  
The threshold for singles has been increased from $24,276 to $26,000. The family  threshold 
has been increased from $40,939 to $43,846. For single seniors and  pensioners, the threshold 
has bee n increased from $38,365 to $41,089. The family  threshold for seniors and pensioners 
has been increased from $53,406 to $57,198.  The family income thresholds will now increase 
by $4,027 for each dependent child,  up from $3,760.   
This measure has already be en provisioned for by the Government.

The Government has legislated permanent tax cuts for all 13.6  million Australian  taxpayers 
from 1  July 2024.   
The tax cuts provide cost -of-living relief, return bracket creep, support women and boost 
labour supply.  Treasury   |   
 
 
 
Part 1: Receipt Measures  |  Page 13 
The Government’s tax changes provide bigger tax cuts for more taxpayers, delivering 
meani ngful cost -of-living relief to middle Australia without adding to inflationary pressures.   
Under the Government’s tax cuts, from 2024 –25: 
• the 19 per cent tax rate will be reduced to 16 per cent   
• the 32.5 per cent tax rate will be reduced to 30 per cent   
• the income threshold above which the 37 per cent tax rate applies will be increased from 
$120,000 to $135,000   
• the income threshold above which the 45 per cent tax rate applies will be increased from 
$180,000 to $190,000.   
This measure is estimated to decr ease receipts by $1.3 billion over the 5  years from 2023 –24.

• Combatting Antisemitism Fund Limited for gifts received from 1  July 2025 to 
30 June  2030   
The Government has also approved DGR status for the Australian Muslim Advocacy  
Network’s AMAN Foundation Ltd.   
The listing of Com batting Antisemitism Fund Limited and Skip Foundation Ltd is  subject 
to charity registration with the Australian Charities and Not -for-profits  Commission.   
In addition, the listing of Skip Foundation Ltd is subject to the condition that DGR funds 
can only be used for purposes consistent with existing DGR categories in the tax law, and it 
will maintain minimum annual distributions consistent with the current requirements for 
ancillary funds.   
  |  Budget Paper No. 2  
 
Page 14  |  Part 1: Receipt Measures  
The Government will also remove the following specifically listed DGRs as the 
organisations are no longer operating:  
• Don Chipp Foundation Ltd   
• Ian Clunies Ross Memorial Foundation   
• Ian Thorpe’s Fountain for Youth   
• Layne Beachley – Aim for The Stars Foundation Limited   
• National Congress of Australia’s First Peoples Limited   
• Sir William Tyree Foundation   
• SouthCare Helicopter Fund Pty Limited   
• The Lingiari Policy Centre Limited .  
Further, the Government will remake the Australian Charities and Not -for-profits  Commission 
(Consequential and Transitional) Regulation 2016 with an extension of  the current charity 
transitional reporting arrangement for five years.   
This measure is estimated to decrease receipts by $3.0  million over the 5  years from

The Government will continue to improve cash flow and reduce compliance costs for small 
businesses by extending the $20,000 instant asset write -off by 12 months until 30  June  2025.  
Small businesses, with an aggregated annual turnover of less than $10  million, will 
continue to be able to immediately deduct the full cost of eligible assets costing less than 
$20,000 that are first used or installed ready for use by 30  June  2025. The asset threshold 
applies on a per asset basis so small businesses can instantly write off multiple assets.  
Assets valued at $20,000 or more (which cannot be immediately deducted) can continue 
to be placed into the small b usiness simplified depreciation pool and depreciated at 
15 per cent in the first income year and 30 per cent each income year thereafter.  
The provisions that prevent small businesses from re -entering the simplified  depreciation 
regime for five years if th ey opt -out will continue to be suspended until 30  June  2025.   Treasury   |

The Government will extend the ATO Personal Income Tax Compliance Program for  one 
year from 1  July 2027.   
This extension will enable the ATO to continue to deliver a combination of proactive, 
preventative and corrective activities in key areas of non -compliance, including 
overclaiming of deductions, incorrect reporting of income and ina ppropriate tax agent 
influence. This will enable the ATO to continue its focus on emerging risks to the tax 
system, such as deductions relating to short -term rental properties.  
This measure is estimated to increase receipts by $180.3  million and increase  payments by 
$44.3  million over the 5  years from 2023 –24.

The Government will provide $187.0  million over four years from 1  July 2024 to the  ATO 
to strengthen its ability to detect, prevent and  mitigate fraud against the tax and 
superannuation systems. Funding includes:  
• $78.7  million for upgrades to information and communications technologies to e nable 
the ATO to identify and block suspicious activity in real time   
• $83.5  million for a new compliance taskforce to recover lost revenue and intervene 
when attempts to obtain fraudulent refunds are made    
  |  Budget Paper No. 2  
 
Page 16  |  Part 1: Receipt Measures  
• $24.8  million to improve the ATO’s management and governance of its counter -fraud 
activities, including improving how the ATO assists individuals harmed by fraud.   
The Government will also provide $0.4  million over four years from 1  July 2024 to the 
Department of Finance to undertake a Gateway Review proc ess over the life of the 
proposal to ensure independent assurance, oversight and delivery of the measure.  
Further, the Government will strengthen the ATO’s ability to combat fraud by extending 
the time the ATO has to notify a taxpayer if it intends to ret ain a business activity statement 
(BAS) refund for further investigation. The ATO’s mandatory notification period for BAS 
refund retention will be increased from 14 days to 30 days to align with time limits for 
non-BAS refunds.  
The extended period will st rengthen the ATO’s ability to combat fraud during peak fraud 
events like the one that triggered Operation Protego. Legitimate refunds will be largely 
unaffected. Any legitimate refunds retained for over 14 days would result in the ATO 
paying interest to th e taxpayer (as is currently the case). The ATO will publish BAS 
processing times online.  
This will have effect from the start of the first financial year after Royal Assent of the 
enabling legislation.  
This measure is estimated to increase receipts by $3 02.2 million and increase  payments by 
$187.4  million over the 5 years from 2023 –24.

This extension of the Shadow Economy Compliance Program will enable the ATO to  
continue to reduce shadow economy activity, thereby protecting revenue and  preventing 
non-compliant businesses from undercutting competition.   
This measure is estimated to increase receipts by $1.9 billion and increase payments by 
$610.2  million over the 5  years from 2023 –24. This includes an increase in GST payments to 
the state s and territories of $429.6  million.  Treasury   |

Australian Taxation Office  - - - 579.3  586.7  
 
The Government will extend the ATO Tax Avoidance Taskforce for two years from 
1 July 2026.   
Extending the Taskforce ensures the ATO continues to be well -resourced to pursue key tax 
avoidance risks, with a focus on multinationals, large public and private businesses, and 
high -wealth individuals.  
This measure is estimated to increase receipts by $2.4 billion and increase payments by 
$1.2 billion over the 5  years from 2023 –24.

The Government will strengthen the foreign resident capital gains tax (CGT) regime to 
ensure foreign residents pay their fair share of tax in Australia and to provide greater 
certainty about the operation of the rules. The amendments will apply to CGT events 
commencing on or after 1  July 2025 to:  
• clarify and broaden the types of assets that foreign residents are subject to CGT on   
• amend the point -in-time principal asset test to a 365 -day testing period   
• require foreign residents disposing of shares and other membership interests exceeding 
$20 million in value to notify the ATO, prior to the transaction being executed.   
This measure will ensure that Australia can tax foreign residents on direct and indirect 
sales of assets with a close economic connection to Australian land, more in line with the 
tax treatment that already applies to Australian residents. The new ATO notification 
process will improve oversight and compliance with the foreign resident CGT withholding 
rules, where a vendor self -assesses their sale is not taxable real property.   
  |  Budget Paper No. 2  
 
Page 18  |  Part 1: Receipt Measures  
These reforms will also improve certainty for foreign investors by aligning Australia’s  tax 
law for foreign resident capital gains more closely with OECD standards and  international 
best practice.   
The Government will consult on the implementation details of the measure.   
This measure is estimated to increase receipts by $600.0  million and increase  payments by 
$8.0 million over the 5  years from 2023 –24.  Part 2: Payment Measures  |  Page 19 Part 2: Payment Measures

• $20.0  million over two years from 2024 –25 for initial design and consultation work on 
reforms to help participants and people with disability navigate services   
• $5.3 million in 2024 –25 for the Independent Health and Aged Care Pricing Authority to 
work with the Department of Social Services and the NDIA to undertake initial work 
to reform NDIS p ricing arrangements, including reviewing existing pricing approaches 
and developing a pricing data strategy.   
The Government will also establish a NDIS Implementation Advisory Committee and 
a NDIS Implementation Working Group, to oversee implementation of reforms 
recommended by the Independent NDIS Review and agreed by Government.  
As an initial response to the Independent NDIS Review, on 6  December  2023 National 
Cabinet agreed to work together to implement legislative and other changes to the NDIS 
to impro ve the experience of participants and restore the original intent of the Scheme to 
support people with permanent and significant disability, within a broader ecosystem of 
supports.  
On 27  March  2024 the Government introduced the National Disability Insuran ce Scheme 
Amendment (Getting the NDIS Back on Track) Bill 2024 No. 1 (the Bill) to Parliament. 
Changes in the Bill are aimed at securing the future of the NDIS and progressing key 
Independent NDIS Review recommendations. The Bill will help the NDIS get bac k on track 
by determining NDIS participant plan budgets more consistently based on participant 
need, supporting participants to spend in accordance with their plans, clarifying the 
information that participants need to provide to support plan reassessments , and clarifying 
what types of supports can be funded. The Bill also provides more flexibility on how 
the NDIS Commissioner can take action to protect NDIS participants from abuse, harm 
and neglect.  
Based on data up to December 2023, the NDIS Actuary proj ected that without further 
action, NDIS payments would increase by $14.4 billion over four years from 2024 –25. 
The NDIS reforms being undertaken by the Government are expected to moderate this 
additional growth to that projected at the 2023 –24 MYEFO, and e nsure the NDIS remains 
on track to achieve the NDIS Sustainability Framework agreed by National Cabinet from 
1 July 2026.  
The Government has already provided partial funding for this measure. Additional costs 
will be partially met from within the existing  resourcing of the Department of Social 
Services, the NDIA, and the Independent Health and Aged Care Pricing Authority.  
This measure builds on the 2022 –23 October Budget measure titled Fraud Fusion  Taskforce , 
the 2023 –24 Budget measure titled Improving th e Effectiveness and  Sustainability of the National 
Disability Insurance Scheme , and the 2023 –24 MYEFO  measure titled Support for the National 
Disability Insurance Scheme .

Part 1: Australia’s Federal Relations   |  Page 1 Part 1: Australia ’s Federal Relations  
Overview  
In 202 4–25, the Australian Government will provide state and territory governments 
(states) with $ 185.9 billion  in total payments , estimated to be 25.3  per cent of total 
Australian  Governme nt expenditure . This includes  payments of $ 91.5 billion  for specific 
purposes including for schools and hospitals, and general revenue assistance of 
$94.4 billion . 
Through its payments to the states, the Australian Government is:  
• contributing $ 133.0  billion  from 202 4–25 to 202 7–28 for public health and 
hospital  services  
• investing $ 127.9 billion  in Quality Schools funding from 202 4–25 to 202 7–28 
• committing $ 57.8 billion  from 202 4–25 to 202 7–28 to invest in nation -building 
infrastructure  
• committing  $3.9 billion from 2024 –25 to 20 25–26 through the  Energy Bill Relief Fund , 
including  an additional $ 3.5 billion  for a one-year extension to provide cost of living 
relief to all Australian households (more than ten million) and around one million small 
businesses  
• making available  a further $1  billion through the Housing Support Program in 2023–24, 
to fund urgent  and significant  infrastructure projects in order to build more homes for 
Australians  in well -located areas. This is in addition to the existing Housing Support 
Program streams, which are providing $500.0 million through  2024–25 to fund enabling 
infrastructure , community amenit ies and planning capability  
• providing an estimated $ 20.4 billion in horizontal fiscal equalisation (HFE) transition  
payments (also known as the No Worse Off guarantee)  from 2024 –25 to 2027 –28 to 
support the transition to the new HFE system  
• permanently boosting the size of the GST pool that is distributed among the states each 
year. From 2021 –22, the Australian Government has inject ed $600.0  million  annually 
into the GST pool, with this amount growing each year in line with the underlying 
growth of the GST. From  2024–25 the Australian Government will further boost the GST 
pool  by an additional  $250.0  million  annually , bringing the total in 2024 –25 to 
$964.1 million .

Box 1.1: Fiscal pressures across the federation  
The Commonwealth and the states and territories (the states) are all facing 
significant  fiscal pressures, which are driven by  current spending pressures and the 
fiscal legacy of the COVID -19 pandemic .  
Current major spending pressures for the Commonwealth include health and aged 
care, the National Disability Insurance Scheme , defence  and interest payments on 
Government debt . In the 2023 Intergenerational Report , these were projected to  rise 
from 8.8  per cent of GDP in 2022–23 to around 14.4  per cent in 2062 –63. Health and 
aged care expenditure is expected to grow significantly with around 40  per cent of 
the projected increase in Commonwealth expenditure from 2022 –23 to 2062 –63 being 
attributed to demographic ageing.  The states are also affected by  fiscal pressures, 
particular ly health  and in terest payments on their own debt.   
The Commonwealth and the states are carrying higher levels of debt c ompared to 
pre-pandemic. Both levels of government used debt to fund the response to the 
pandemic, resulting in debt levels which were high by historical standards.  The 
Commonwealth funded a larger share of pandemic -related expenditure , as it  is 
responsibl e for social security and almost 60 per cent  of health funding .  
Despite these current and legacy  pressures, the states are expecting their budget 
balances to recover over the forward  estimates , with most states reaching an 
operating surplus by 2026 –27 (Chart 1. 1). The states forecast that the aggregate net 
operating position , which incorporates Commonwealth transfers,  will be balanced 
on average across the forward  estimates . The Commonwealth is forecast to remain in 
an operating deficit over the same p eriod .

Box 1.1: Fiscal pressures across  the federation (continued)  
Commonwealth support ensures the states can fund essential services . The states are 
estimated to receive $193.7  billion in annual Commonwealth payments on avera ge 
over the forward  estimates . The Commonwealth has recently increased funding in 
key areas  of shared responsibility , including :  
• an additional $ 7 billion in new commitments to the states for housing since 
May  2022, taking total payments to the states for housing to more than  $17 billion 
over ten years ; not including the Housing Australia Future Fund, under which 
states can apply for funding for social and affordable housing   
• extend ing the GST No Worse Off guarantee (NoWO)  by three years to 2029–30 to 
provide funding ce rtainty to states . It is estimated the total cost of the 2018 GST 
distribution reforms , which include the NoWO, annual pool boost  and top -up 
transitional payments , will be $52.9 billion  from 2019 –20 to 2029–30  
• increas ing infrastructure payments , with annual payments for infrastructure 
services forecast to average $ 14.4 billion  from 2024 –25 to 2027 –28.  
The Commonwealth and the states have been discussing the implications of the 
recent High Court decision in Vanderstock & Anor v State of Victoria . The 
Commonwealth has been working with the states to ensure they have secure 
own -source revenue bases, and wi ll continue to explore options, including 
legislative options, to protect state revenue sources.  
Tackling fiscal pressures across the federation will require collaborative solutions 
and can be complemented by actions of individual governments to ensure essential 
service delivery and fiscal sustainability.

Australian Government funding to the states  
The Australian Government provides substantial funding to the states in key sectors  such 
as health, education and community services, and supports important productivity  
enhancing projects and reforms, such as investments in infrastructure and skills. 
In addition, the Australian Government provides general revenue assistance that states can 
spend according to their own budget priorities.  
The states are estimated to receive total Australian Government payments of $ 185.9 billion  
in 202 4–25.  
Payments to the states in 202 4–25 are estimated to be 25.3 per cent of total 
Australian  Government expenditure and 6.7 per cent of GDP.

Payments for specific purposes  
In 202 4–25, the Australian Government will provide the states with $91.5 billion  in 
payments for specific purposes. This represents an increase of $7.6 billion  or 9.0 per cent 
compared with  the 202 3–24 estimate , primarily due to the expansion of the Energy Bill 
Relief  Fund , and increases in  National Health Reform and Quality Schools  funding . 
Payments for specific purposes are estimated to make up 12.5 per cent of total 
Australian  Government expenditure in 202 4–25 and be 3.3 per cent of GDP.  
Payments for skills and workforce development activities (including through the new 
National Skills Agreement ), National Health Reform, the National Agreement on Social 
Housing and Homelessness , and Quality Schools funding are expected to total $ 64.5 billion 
in 202 4–25. 
National Partnership payments are expected to be $24.0 billion  in 202 4–25. 
Chart 1. 2 shows estimated specific purpose payments to the states in 202 4–25 by sector.  
Part 2 of this Budget Paper provides further information on payments to the states for 
specific purposes.  
The conditions for payments to states for specific purposes are documented in agreements 
between the Commonwealth and the states. The Federation Funding A greement (FFA) 
Framework sets out the governance arrangements for these agreements. Further 
information on the FFA Framework can be found on the Federal Financial Relations 
website at www.federalfin ancialrelations.gov.au .

including $ 88.5 billion  for the GST entitlement. General revenue assistance to the states is 
estimated to represent 12.9 per cent of total Australian Government expenditure in  2024–25 
and be 3.4 per cent of GDP.

revenue sharing relativities for each financial year. They are calculated using the Commonwealth Grants 
Commission ’s 2024–25 GST relativities as the starting point. The estimates do not reflect any att empt to 
project future GST relativities or GST entitlements. See  Part 3 for further information.

 Part 2: Payments for specific purposes   |  Page 15 Part 2: Payments  for specific purposes  
Overview  
The Australian Government provides payments to state and territory governments ( states) 
for specific purposes in policy areas for which the states have primary responsibility. These 
payments cover most areas of state and local government activity, including health, 
education, skills and workforce development, community services, housi ng, Indigenous 
affairs, infrastructure,  and the environment.  
Schools funding payments under the Australian Education Act  2013  is the largest specific 
purpose payment to the states, estimated to be $30.2 billion  in 202 4–25, comprising funding 
for government  schools of $11.5 billion and non -government schools of $ 18.7 billion.  
Funding for public hospitals under the National Health Reform Agreement is the second 
largest specific purpose payment to the states, estimated to be $30.1 billion in  2024–25.  
In 202 4–25, the Australian Government is supporting the states in the Skills and Workforce 
Development sector by providing $2.4 billion through the National Skills A greement .  
In 202 4–25, the Australian Government has offered the states  an estimated $1.8 billion 
under the National Agreement on Social Housing and Homelessness. Funding will support 
the effective operation of Australia ’s social housing and homelessness s ervices and help 
those people who are at risk of or are experiencing homelessness.  
In 2024 -25, the Australian  Government is providing $3.0 billion for Energy Bill Relief, with 
an additional $871.6 million  to be provided  in 202 5–26. 
National Partnership payments to the states are the key vehicle to facilitate reforms or 
support the delivery of particular projects and services. Funding agreements are typically 
entered into for a fixed period of time, reflecting the nature of the project or refo rm 
involved.  
To the fullest extent possible, National Partnership payments are aligned to the 
achievement of milestones and are made after the states have achieved the outcomes or 
outputs specified in the relevant agreement. National Partnership payments a re estimated 
to be $24.0 billion in 202 4–25. 
Funding agreements and other Commonwealth -State agreements are publicly available on 
the Federal Financial Relations website at: www.federalfinancialrela tions.gov.au . Details of 
the appropriation mechanisms for all payments to the states and the terms and conditions 
applying to them are set out in Appendix  E, available online.  
Further information on each of these payments is contained in this Part. Total payments to 
the states for specific purposes, categorised by functions, are set out in Appendix  B, which 
is available online.     |  Budget Paper No. 3

The Australian Government is providing funding for state -led efficiency measures in the 
Murray–Darling Basin under the WESA. This will improve the efficiency of water delivery 
infrastructure and increase the volume of environmental water in the Murray –Darling 
Basin, leading to improved river health, agricultural  activity and generating benefits for the 
local and regional communities. This program is being replaced by the Resilient Rivers 
Water Infrastructure Program to deliver against the Water Amendment (Restoring Our Rivers) 
Act 2023.

The Australian Government provides funding under the Disaster Recovery Funding 
Arrangements (DRFA) to assist the states in relief and recovery efforts following natural 
disasters. The Government recognises a liability equal to the present value of future 
payments expected to be made to the states under the DRFA. The liability is based on 
estimated data provided by the states. It includes both known and future estimated 
expenditure for relief and recovery measures prior to states submitting a claim to the 
Australian Government.  
The total cost of relief and recovery from disaster events may not be completely realised for 
some years. Current estimates for the DRFA are based on the information available at the 
time of preparation for past events. These estimate s do not include other , as yet , 
unquantifiable support  payments  in relation to disasters that will be provided through the 
DRFA.  
Estimated expenditure related to all natural disasters is regularly reviewed and revised by 
the states as new information becomes available, and this, or the occurrence of future 
natural disasters, can significantly affect the estimated DRFA liability and payments. More 
information is available in Budget Paper No.  1, Budget  Strategy and Outlook  2024–25,

a) Funding of $3.1  billion  was brought forward from 2023 –24 and paid in 2022 –23 in recognition of the 
workforce, supply chain and cashflow pressures that local governments face , hence the figures in  
2023–24 are lower than in other years .  
 
The Financial Assistance Grant program consists of two components: a general purpose 
component and a local road component. The general purpose component is the larger 
component and is distributed between the states on a per -capita basis, while the local ro ad 
component is distributed between the states according to fixed historical  shares.  
Funding under the Financial Assistance Grant program is paid through state governments 
to local governments. State grants commissions determine the intrastate distribution  of the 
grants between local governments. Both funding components are untied and can be spent 
according to each local government ’s own  priorities.  
The Australian Government will continue to work with states in relation to the financial 
support  of the local  government sector, including advancing funding earlier than would 
usually occur.

Part 3: General revenue assistance   |  Page 121  Part 3: General revenue assistance  
Overview  
General revenue assistance is provided to state and territ ory governments (states), without 
conditions, to spend according to their own budget priorities. In 202 4–25, the states are 
expected to receive $ 94.4 billion from the Australian Government in total general revenue 
assistance, which is estimated to represen t 12.9 per cent of total Australian Government 
expenditure in that year. This consists of the GST entitlement of $88.5  billion  (comprising 
GST revenue and the Commonwealth funded GST pool boost), horizontal fiscal 
equalisation  (HFE ) transition payments of $ 5.2 billion  (also known as the No Worse Off 
guarantee)  and $ 711.4 million  of other general revenue assistance.  
Total GST -related payments to the states (GST entitlements plus HFE transition payments) 
are estimated to increase from $ 93.7 billion in 202 4–25 and reach $ 108.8  billion by  2027–28.  
2024–25 is the fourth  year in the 6 -year transition to the updated GST distribution system, 
which will ensure that no state will have a per capita GST share lower than the fiscally 
stronger of New South Wales or Victoria. It is also the first year that th e GST relativity floor 
of 0.7 5 is in effect , which means a state’s GST share cannot fall below this level . During this 
transition, the Australian  Government has guaranteed, through legislation, that each state 
will not receive less than they would have und er the previous GST distribution system 
using, if necessary, HFE transition payments.  In December  2023, the Australian  
Government agreed to extend this guarantee for three years until 2029 –30. 
Estimated general revenue assistance provided to the states by the Australian  Government 
is shown in Table  3.1. Table  1.1 in Part  1 shows a breakdown by  state.

2027–28 HFE transition payment is assumed to be 80 per cent and 60  per cent respectively of that

GST payments  
Under the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 , the states are ent itled to receive payments 
from the Australian Government equivalent to the revenue raised from the GST in any 
given financial year, subject to some minor adjustments. From 2021 –22, the states’ GST 
entitlements are boosted each year by additional Australian  Government funding as 
discussed below.  
The Australian Government makes monthly payments (advances) to the states throughout 
the year based on GST estimates for that year. Estimates of the GST are used as the actual 
amount of GST revenue for the financial year is unknown until after the end of the financial 
year. Once the amount of GST revenue is known, the Treasurer makes a determination of 
the GST entitlement for that year. A balancing adjustment is made to each state’s payments 
to ensure they receive the  GST to which they are entitled. These balancing adjustments 
(referred to as the ‘prior year balancing adjustment’) are made in the following financial 
year.  
Calculating the GST payments  
Adjustments and additions are made  to GST revenue to calculate the amount of GST paid 
to the states in any given year. In particular, adjustments are made to move from GST 
revenue (an accrual concept) to GST (cash) receipts as GST receipts are the basis for the GST 
paid to the states.  
• Some GST revenue accrued during a financial year is not remitted to the 
Australian  Taxation Office (ATO) by 30  June of that year because it is not due to be paid 
until Business Activity Statements (BAS) are lodged in the following financial year. For 
taxpa yers other than Australian Government agencies, this accrued amount is included 
in GST revenue but not in GST receipts.  
• Penalties owed to the ATO, other than general interest charge (GIC) penalties, are not 
included in the GST to be paid to the states as d efined in the Federal Financial Relations 
Act 2009 . 
• Some GST collected by Australian Government agencies is not remitted to the ATO by 
30 June in each financial year because it is not due to be paid until the next BAS 
is lodged. This amount is included in Australian Government receipts but is not 
included in GST payments to the states until it is remitted to the ATO.  
• From 2021 –22, the Australian Government is boosting the states’ GST entitlement each 
year with additional funding. From 2021 –22, the Australian Government has inject ed 
$600.0  million annually into the GST pool, with this amount grow ing in line with the 
underlying growth of the GST . From 2024 –25 the Australian Government will further 
boost the GST pool by an additional  $250.0  million  annually . This additional funding 
will be distributed to the states in the same way as GST revenue.   
Budget Paper No. 3   |   
 
Part 3: General revenue assistance   |  Page 123 
In 202 2–23, the states’ G ST entitlement was $ 350.9 million higher than the advances paid 
during that year. A prior year balancing adjustment has been made to states’ GST 
payments in 202 3–24 to reflect this.

The states’ GST entitlement is expected to reach $ 104.5  billion by 202 7–28. Since the 
2023 –24 MYEFO , the GST  entitlement has been revised down  by $927.5 million in 202 4–25 
and $5.5 billion over the five years from 202 3–24 to 202 7–28. 
Excluding new policy decisions, the GST entitlement has been revised down by 
$922.5 million in 2024 –25 and $5.9  billion over the five years from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28, 
driven by the change in GST receipts . GST receipts have been upgraded in 2023 –24 due to 
stronger than expected collections. From 2024 –25 the downgrade is driven by the lower 
outlook for nominal consumption subject to GST, partially offset by higher nominal 
dwelling investment.

revenue sharing relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission 
(the CGC).  
The detailed calculation for the distribution of the GST entitlement in 202 4–25 is shown in 
Table  3.5. This method of calculation is prescribed in the Federa l Financial Relations Act  2009 .

In 2018, the Australian Government reformed the system of HFE to provide a fairer way to 
distribute the GST among the states. From 2021 –22, the system began its transition to a 
more stable and predictable equalisation standard that will reduce volatility i n states’ GST 
payments.  
To support the states’ transition to the new system, the Australian Government provided 
an additional $5.2  billion in transitional GST top -up payments over the three  years to  
2021 –22 to ensure that no state ha d an effective GST relativity below  0.7, or 4.66024 for the 
Northern Territory. At the time of the 2018 reforms, it was estimated that $1.8  billion in 
top-up payments would be required over those three  years.  
From 2022 –23, the new HFE system include d a rel ativity floor of 0.7, permanently 
increasing to 0.75 in 2024 –25. Further, the Australian Government has guaranteed  that each 
state will receive at least the cumulative better of the old or the new HFE system for the 
nine  years from 2021 –22 to 2029–30. The HFE transition payments associated with this 
guarantee are outlined in Table  3.1. 
The CGC does not forecast GST sharing relativities beyond the budget year. The 
distribution of GST among the states and any resulting transitional payments for 202 5–26 is 
calculated based on a technical assumption that uses the 202 4–25 relativities as the starting 
point, which are then adjusted to reflect the transition to the updated distribution system.  
In 2026 –27 and 2027 –28, this assumption is changed on the basis that re lativities will slowly 
begin to revert toward historical averages  as commodity prices are  assumed to fall from 
their current levels . However , the three year lag in the CGC’s relativity calculations means 
that the reversion will be more gradual than previou sly anticipated. Given this, the 
transitional payment s for 2026 –27 and 2027 –28 are assumed to be 80 per cent and 
60 per cent respectively , of what would be expected from using the 2024 –25 relativities. The 
estimates (shown in Table  3.1) do not reflect any attempt to project future GST relativities 
or GST entitlements.

Page 126  |  Part 3: General revenue assistance  
The Australian  Government is expected to provide an estimated $ 20.4 billio n in HFE 
transition payments from 202 4–25 to 202 7–28 to support the transition to the new HFE 
system.  
GST administration  
States compensate the Australian Government for the costs incurred by the ATO for 
administering  the GST, including costs incurred by the Department of Home Affairs. 
In practice, this is achieved by the Australian Government reducing the monthly GST 
payments to the states by the GST administration costs.  
The GST administration budget for the ATO is estimated to be $ 709.0  million for 202 4–25, 
as shown in Table  3.6.

Australian Capital Territory municipal services  
The Australian Government provides general revenue assistance to the Australian Capital 
Territory to assist in meeting the additional municipal costs that arise from Canberra’s role 
as the national capital. The payments also compensate the Australian Capital T erritory for 
additional costs resulting from the national capital planning influences on the provision of 
water and sewerage services.  
Royalty payments  
Western Australia  
The Australian Government provides general revenue assistance to Western Australia from 
royalties collected under the Offshore  Petroleum  (Royalty)  Act 2006  in respect of the 
North  West Shelf oil and gas project off the coast of Western Australia. The  Austr alian 
Government collects these royalties because it has jurisdiction over offshore areas.  
Royalties are shared between the Australian Government (approximately one third) and 
Western Australia (approximately two thirds). These revenue sharing arrangements  are set 
out in the Offshore  Petroleum  and Greenhouse  Gas Storage  Act 2006 . 
Compensation for reduced royalties  
The Australian Government provides general revenue assistance to compensate 
Western  Australia for the loss of royalty revenue resulting from the removal of the 
exemption of condensate from crude oil excise in the 2009–10 Budget .  
Mirror tax arrangements  
The Australian Government introduced mirror tax arrangements in 1998 to ensure that the 
states were not financ ially disadvantaged by the High Court decision in Allders  International 
Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue (Victoria) , which invalidated state taxes on 
Commonwealth places. These arrangements mirror certain state taxes, including payroll 
taxes, land t axes and stamp duties, with respect to Commonwealth places. The states collect 
these mirror taxes on behalf of the Australian Government and bear the administrative 
costs of collection.  
All mirror tax revenues are credited to the Australian Government and simultaneously 
appropriated to the states with no net impact on the Australian Government’s budget 
position as shown in Table  3.8.

Population  
Population data are used to distribute funding between the state and territory governments 
(states) and in the calculation of annual growth factors.  
Estimates of state populations  
The Centre for Population in the Department of the Treasury  (the Centre) constructs s tate 
population projections  using the latest demographic data and incorporating  assumptions 
regarding fertility, mortality, net overseas migration and net interstate migration.  
The Centre estimates population and components of change on a financial year basis. 
Projected population for the mid -point of the financial year (31 December, Table  A.1) is the 
simple average of the population at the beginning and end of the financial year (Table  A.2).

Fertility  
Assumptions about the fertility rate are based on analysis undertaken and commissioned 
by the Centre  (Table A.3). The total fertility rate is assumed to be 1.6 4 babies per woman in 
2023–24 before falling to 1.6 3 by 202 7–28. Projected state fertility rates are assumed to move 
in line with the nati onal fertility rate.

Mortality  
Assumptions about life expectancy at birth are based on the Australian Government 
Actuary mortality improvement factors and the 2019 –21 Australian Bureau of  Statistics life 
tables (Table A.4). Life expectancies have been adjusted until 2025–26 to account for the 
impact of COVID -19. Life expectancies are then assumed to improve at the same average 
annual rate that has been observed over the past three  decades.  Projected state mortality 
rates are assumed to move in line with the national mortality  rate.

Net overseas migration  
The Centre forecasts net overseas migration (Table A.5). The forecasts incorporate official 
statistics prepared by the Australian Bureau of Statistics , as well as information provided 
by the Department of Home Affairs, including data on international arrivals and 
departures,  offshore visa grants, and the number of temporary visa holders in Australia.

Preface   |  Page  1 Purpose of Budget  Paper No. 4  
Budget Paper No. 4 presents information on the full allocation of resources across the 
General Government Sector . 1 In 2024–25, agencies will be responsible for administering 
approximately $ 734.5  billion  to deliver services for individuals, families and businesses.   
Budget  Paper No. 4 sets out the departmental funding for agencies, administered 
funding managed by agenc ies, the nature of funding sources and the purposes of 
funding as defined by Outcome Statements for each agency.  
Additionally , information is provided on the staffing resources allocated to agencies 
delivering services to the Australian community.  
— 
1  The General Government  Sector provides public services that are mainly non -market in 
nature and for the collective consumption of the community or involve the transfer or 
distribution of income. These services are largely financed through taxes and other 
compulsory levies, user charging and exter nal funding (Budget 2024 –25, Budget Paper No. 1, 
Statement 10, Appendix A ).  
 
 
Preface   |  Page  3 Preface  
The Government has a strong record of delivering outcomes for all Australians . The public 
service is essential to delivering these outcomes, doing everything from processing 
Centrel ink payments and Medicare rebates, to protecting Australia ’s borders and economic 
interests, supporting job creation, responding to natural disasters, and helping to deliver 
the clean energy transition. The actions the Government is taking to rebuild the Australian 
Public Service (APS)  and reduce its reliance on consultants and contractors recognises that 
delivering outcomes for Australians must be built on the foundations of a strong public 
service.   
After a lmost a  decade of outsourcing , reduced service ou tcomes  and underinvestment by 
the previous  Government, o ver the past two years the Government has invested in the 
public service to ensure it is best placed to do the job the Australian people expect. The 
public service needs  people to deliver services acr oss the country, support Australia ’s 
economic growth and  keep Australians safe.  
The 2024 –25 Budget builds on this investment, responding to the challenges of today and 
investing in a better future. The Budget helps ease cost -of-living pressures and suppor ts 
building more homes for Australians. It lays the foundations of an ambitious strategy to 
build a future made in Australia , while invest ing in strengthening Medicare and building a 
strong , sustainable care economy. At the same time, the Budget  delivers  on the 
Government ’s commitment to  responsible economic management, broadening opportunity 
and improving equality.  
The Government is delivering on its election commitment to reduce the public service ’s 
reliance on consultants, contractors, and la bour hire, which delivered a $3  billion saving in 
the 2022–23 October Budget. Demonstrating the Government ’s commitment to responsible 
economic management, the  2024–25 Budget  delivers an additional saving of  $1 billion  over 
four years  from 2024 -25 by reduc ing spending on external labour, bringing the total savings 
to $4 billion .  
The Government will conduct a new Audit of Employment  to measure and track how the 
public service is continuing to deliver on the Government ’s commitment to reduce its 
reliance on external labour, coupled with targets established under the APS Strategic 
Commissioning Framework , to bring core public service work back into the public service .  
The Government has an ambitious agenda for Australia and the effectiveness of the public 
service is central to successfully implementing the Government ’s commitments  to the 
Australian people.

The impact  of the previous  Government ’s Average Staffing 
Level cap 
The 2023 Audit of Employment identified that the previous  Government suppressed the 
true size of the public service, with an artificially low and misleading public service 
headcount augmented by a shadow workforce of tens of thousands of consultants and 
contractors. Abolishing the arbitrary Average Staffing Level (ASL) cap in 2022 was an 
important first step towards  rebuilding the public service and ensuring that the jobs that 
need to be done are delivered more effectively and more cost -efficiently by publi c servants.  
The arbitrary restrictions on the size of the public service under the ASL cap had nothing to 
do with achieving efficiencies. The shadow workforce came at a costly premium for 
taxpayers without offering the value for money the Australian people expect. Und er the 
previous  Government, departmental spending in nominal terms rose 35 per cent between 
2012–13 and 2021 –22, whereas ASL numbers fell by four  per cent over the same period.  
Audit of Employment  
The 2023 Audit of Employment provided an estimate of the u se of 
external labour (contractors, consultants, outsourced service 
providers and labour hire) across the public service under the 
previous  Government. The Audit brought together information on 
the use of external labour by 112 agencies across the public s ervice that employ staff 
under the Public Service Act 1999  and found that in 2021 –22 these agencies employed 
an external labour workforce of 53,900 staff on a full -time equivalent basis at a cost 
of $20.8 billion.  
The Audit also found that  around one in every four  dollars spent by agencies for 
departmental purposes was on external labour .  
The impacts of the previous Government ’s ASL cap policy were two -fold. In the early 
years, departmental funding was reduced by around 10 per cent in real terms while the size 
of the public service was reduced by a similar amount. These reductions diminished the 
ability of the public service to provide high -quality policy advice and deliver the services 
and programs that Australians expect of their government. Fro m around 2015, funding to 
government agencies began to increase, but the ASL cap forced agencies to outsource core 
services using contracted labour or third -party service providers rather than public service 
employees. By 2022, employment in the public ser vice was around 14 per cent below the 
level it would have been had ASL  growth kept up with the growth in departmental 
expenses in the absence of the ASL cap (Chart 1).

Reducing  the public service ’s reliance on consultants and 
contractors  
In October 2023 , the Government released new instructions for the public service  to limit 
the use of contractors a nd consultants. The APS Strategic Commissioning Framework  requires 
core government work  to be done by public service employees, such as policy formulation, 
drafting Cabinet submissions, developing legislation and regulations , and limits 
outsourcing of core work to defined circumstances . 
All agencies that employ staff under the Public Service Act 1999  are now required to collect 
data on their use of the external workforce and how it is reducing over time . This will be 
reported in Annual Reports from 2024 onwards , for accountability and transparency 
purposes.  8090100110120130140

By rebalancing and rebuilding the public service, the Government has converted 
contractors into public service roles and achieved savings through reduced spending on 
consultants, contractors, and other external labour. Since the 2022 –23 October Budget, 
8,816 public service roles have been created to replace work previously undertaken by 
consultants  and contractors . This includes:  
• 5,816 roles that have been explicitly converted from contracted positions to public 
service positions . The 2024 –25 Budget includ es 2,502 additional conversions  in addition 
to the  3,314 conversions reported in the 2023 –24 Budget    
• 3,000  roles  in Services Australia that are now being performed by public servants 
instead of through outsourced arrangements. The Government is providing funding for 
public servants when extending terminating funding, instead of funding for outsourced 
arrangements, a s was occurring because of the previous  Government ’s arbitrary ASL 
cap. 
The use of the largest consulting firms has significantly reduced under the Government, 
dropping in value by $624 million year -to-date for 2023 –24 compared to the same period in 
2021–22. On average, use of the largest  consulting firms was $84 million  less each month for 
the first half of 2023–24 than for the same period in 2021 –22.  
To support the public service  to do its core work in -house, instead of outsourcing to more 
expensive priv ate providers, the Government has established an in -house consulting 
function, Australian Government Consulting. While still scaling up, Australian 
Government Consulting is undertaking management and strategy consulting work in 
partnership with public serv ice agencies. It  is also strengthening public service capability 
and supporting agencies  to get better value when engaging external consultants .  
Building on the work of Australian Government Consulting, the Department of Defence 
(Defence) will look to initiate a pilot program (Australian Defence Consulting) to provide 
internal consultancy support across Defence using public service and Australian Defence 
Force staff. This will further reduce Defence ’s need for high -cost external support and build 
the ca pability of its public sector workforce.  
Rebuilding an efficient public service that delivers for 
Australians  
In rebuilding the  public service  over the past two years, the Government has worked to 
repair the damaging effects of the previous Government ’s arbitrary ASL cap  by 
appropriately fund ing and resourc ing the public service to deliver on the Government ’s 
priorities. In doing so, it has kept the relative size of the public service well below historic al 
levels of public se rvice  resourcing, when measured as a proportion of the total Australian 
population and the labour force  (Chart 2).  At the same time, the public service is doing 
more as the roles and responsibilities of the Commonwealth have expanded in line with the 
needs and expectations of Australians .  Budget Paper No.4   |

In 2024–25, total ASL in the public service is expected to be around 209,000 . This is about 
17,000  below the level that would be consistent with the relative size of the public service in 
2006–07 as a percentage of the labour force ( which would be around 226,000 in 2024–25).  
Over the past two decades, population growth, increasing economic complexity, 
engagement with new and emerging technologies and an increasingly challenging 
geo-strategic environment have led to increased expectations on the Australian 
Government to expand services and enter new fields of responsibility. These include taking 
on new or expanded roles in:  
• supporting aged care , health care  and Australians with disabilities through significant 
reforms such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), robust aged care 
provision and regulation, and ongoing enhancements to our national health care system  
• addressing security concerns and threats through transformational investments in our 
national capabilities in cyber  security, law enforcem ent, intelligence and defence 
(including AUKUS)  
• managing the economic transformation required to address climate change and deliver 
an effective energy transition, and deal with increasing digitisation.  0.50.60.70.80.9

Instead of paying a premium for outsourced capabilit y, in many cases for work public 
servants are capable of doing, the Government is ensuring that the public service is 
equipped to deliver essential frontline services, protect Australians and secure our region.  
Additionally, the Government is tackling crit ical policy issues , including easing 
cost-of-living pressures, building a future made in Australia,  promoting a strong care 
economy,  driving the energy transition, and providing  solutions that support people to 
meet their housing needs .  
To respond to thes e pressing issues, the Government has invested in new agencies to 
ensure the public service is best placed to meet the needs of Australians. These include 
establishing the Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence Commission, the National 
Anti -Corruption Commis sion, the Australian Submarine Agency, the Office of the 
Inspector -General of Aged Care, and the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the 
Environment and Water. Legislation is also before Parliament to establish the Net Zero 
Economy Authority.  
Investing in the public service to improve services and support 
Australians  
The Government has made significant investments in frontline service delivery agencies, 
such as Services Australia, the Department of Veterans ’ Affairs, the National Disability 
Insurance Agency and the Australian Tax ation  Office. This makes sure there  are more 
essential frontline staff to deliver improved services and support for Australians across the 
country. Further, investments in the Department of Health and Aged Care support  the 
Government ’s efforts to strengthen  Medicare  and increase bulk billin g rates,  and progress 
critical reforms in aged care to provide  quality, safer and more accessible aged care for all 
Australians who need it.  
Sixty -two per cent of public servants are located outside of Canberra, across all states and 
territories, Australi a’s external territories and overseas (Graph 1).  The Government ’s 
approach to rebuilding the public service to meet Australia ’s diverse community needs is 
supporting employment opportunities and improving service delivery right around the 
country.  Budget Paper No.4   |

The Government ’s investments in service delivery  are essential  to rebuild a fit -for-purpose 
public service that is resourced to deliver the services Australians expect . This has 
demonstrated clear benefits, including:  
• clearing the 41, 799 backlog of veteran ’s compensation claims in the Department of 
Veterans ’ Affairs, which are now all allocated for processing  
• resolvin g 500,000 claims from Service s Australia ’s claims backlog in just ten weeks due 
to 3,000 additional staff funded in the 2023 –24 Mid -Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 
(MYEFO)  
• increasing compliance activity through more NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission  
staff, resulting in additional banning orders being applied to disability support 
providers doing the wrong thing   
• blocking more than 300,000 attempts by cyber criminals to use Australians ’ stolen 
identity documents through investment s in the Credential P rotection Register .

Page 10  |  Preface  
Investing in the Department of Veterans ’ Affairs  
The Government ’s investment in the public service is supporting 
veterans and their families. The Royal Commission into  Defence and 
Veteran Suicide  interim report found that the previous 
Government ’s ASL cap led to more labour hire staff, higher staff 
turnover rates and, consequently lower proficiency among claims processing staff. 
Veterans were negatively affected by lower overall levels of staff pr oficiency through 
reduced corporate knowledge, greater chance of mistakes, and reduced efficiency ; 
resulting in claims processing delays. Poor experiences of the claims processing 
systems were found to have  had serious impacts on the mental health outcomes  of 
veterans.  
In responding to the interim report, the Government injected significant resourcing 
into the Department of Veterans ’ Affairs—including 500 ongoing ASL in the 2022 –23 
October Budget and a further $82.7 million in the 2023 –24 Budget to help cl ear the 
claims backlog and provide increased support to veterans during the claims process.  
The support to veterans and their families continues in the 2024 –25 Budget with a 
further investment of $186 million over four years from 2024 –25, and $20.6 millio n 
ongoing from 2028 –29 to reduce the time taken to process claims and to meet service 
delivery pressures now that the Department of Veterans ’ Affairs has cleared the 
claims backlog.   
Payments to veterans are expected to increase by $6.5 billion over five years from 
2023–24 due to more claims being processed because of increased staffing levels  that 
the Government has agreed in order to deliver on its commitment to clear the 
backlog . 
Alongside boosting frontline service delivery, the Government is also investing in the 
public service to enable delivery of new and improved digital solutions to improve 
essential services for Australians, aligned with the vision of simple, secure and conn ected 
public services set out in the Data and Digital Government Strategy .  
These platforms, such as myGov with over 26 million active accounts and an average of 
840,000 sign -ins every day, provide Australians with a central place, and easy access to the 
government services they need with the confidence that their data is safe.

Preface   |  Page 11 
Investing in digital health solutions  
The Government ’s investments in the Australian Digital Health 
Agency are providing support to patients and health care 
providers, improving  secure access to the clinical information  they 
need in a broader range of settings and through new innovative 
products such as the My Health App and Provider Connect Australia, improving 
health outcomes for Australians.  
The use of digital health  infrastructure has seen the proportion of specialists 
registered to use the My Health Record more than double, increasing from 
18 per cent to 48  per cent, between December 2021 and December 2023. Registrations 
for residential aged care providers has also grown significantly, from 13 per cent 
to 33 per cent for the same period.  
Driven by the share -by-default agenda, announced as a part of the Strengthening 
Medicare Taskforce, significant growth in usage is also seen in pathology and 
diagnostic imaging. Ther e was a 173 per cent growth in reports uploaded between 
December  2021 and December 2023, with a peak of over 3 million combined 
pathology and diagnostic imaging reports uploaded in a single week in March 2024.   
The Government is expanding the Digital ID System to provide a secure, convenient, 
voluntary and inclusive way for people to verify their identity online. Once a person has a 
Digital ID, they will no longer have to provide copies of their ID documents to businesses 
or government to verif y who they are, and businesses will no longer have to store this 
information reducing the risks and impacts of data breaches and cyber -attacks. More than 
12 million Australians already have a myGovID .  
The Government ’s investment in the National Anti -Scam Centre has helped reverse the 
long -term trend of rising losses to scams, with Australians reporting 13.1 per cent, or 
$400  million, fewer losses in 2023 compared to 2022 .  
The Government has also invested in integrity measures across the public service to ensure 
a harmful failure like the Robodebt Scheme can never happen again. This includes 
establishing the National Anti -Corruption Commission and investing in the new 
Administrative Review Tribunal (to replace the Administrative Appeals Tribunal). It also 
involves addressing the issues raised by the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme, 
including enhancing the quality of legal advice to the Cabinet, re -establishing the 
Administrative Review Council and providing additional capacity for the Office of the  
Commonwealth Ombudsman to handle complaints and undertake investigations of 
systemic issues .

The 2024 –25 Budget includes further investments in the public service to improve service 
delivery and support Australians , including  investment in essential pu blic service staff in :  
• Service s Australia to ensure Australians can access critical payments;  enhance  the 
ongoing safety and security arrangements for customers  and staff; and  put myGov  on a 
more sustainable footing   
• the Department of Veterans ’ Affairs to increase claims processing capabilities to meet

• the Australian Taxation Office to increase  capability to bolster tax compliance and 
protect our taxation and superannuation systems against fraud  
• the Department of Finance, Services Australi a, the Australian Taxation Office, and 
supporting agencies including regulators  to expand the Digital ID system to advance 
Australia ’s digital economy   
• the Australian Digital Health Agency to deliver new digital solutions to improve service 
delivery and increase growth of My Health Record.  Budget Paper No.4   |   
 
 
Preface   |  Page 13 
Investing in Services Australia  
An injection of over 4,000  permanent frontline staff  into Services 
Australia is ensuring Australians can get the help they need, when 
and where they need it. Investment in these services has  reduced 
wait times for Australians accessing important services and 
payments, including  JobSeeker, Paid Parental Leave, and PBS Safety Net claims.  
This has seen a backlog of 500,000 Centrelink and Medicare claims significantly 
reduced in just ten weeks , meaning more financial supports are getting to 
Australians dealing with cost -of-living pressures. These new recruits work in smart 
centres in capital cities and regional centres, including Port Macquarie and 
Coffs  Harbour in New South Wales, Toowoomba and Maryborough in Queensland, 
and Ballarat and the LaTrobe  Valley in Victoria.  
With the support of additional funding, including $2.8  billion  in the 2024–25 Budget , 
Services Australia is modernising its face -to-face services, improving service 
standards, exte nding its emergency response capability, enhancing safety and 
security for  customers and  staff and sustaining the myGov platform.  
 
Investing in the public service  to secure our region , build resilience  and 
protect Australians  
The public service provides essential support to Australians, both at home and 
internationally, in times of need and crisis. The Government remains committed to defence 
and national security and is responding to the most challenging strategic circumstances 
Australia has face d since the Second World War. Investments across the Defence, Home 
Affairs, Attorney -General’s and Foreign Affairs portfolios have an important role to play in 
securing our region and protecting Australians.

Page 14  |  Preface  
Investing  in the public service to deliver AUK US 
The public service has a vital role in delivering the 2024 National 
Defence Strategy and the Integrated Investment Plan . AUKUS 
Pillar s I and II will require a highly skilled and specialised APS 
and industry workforce to deliver new and accelerated 
defen ce capability.  
The recently established Australian Submarine Agency will create 900 new public 
service jobs by 2026 –27 to support the delivery of a conventionally -armed 
nuclear -powered submarine capability for Australia, with significant flow on 
benefits for Australian jobs within defence industry.  
As part of the investment in AUKUS Pillar II, Defence will establish the Advanced 
Strategic Capabilities Accelerator to rapidly translate innovative and advanced 
technologies into defence capabilities. Compleme nting this, public service staff are 
working with international counterparts and industry on delivering AUKUS Pillar 
II, accelerating the development and delivery of advanced military capabilities.  
 
Investing in cyber security  
The Government has made significant investments in cyber security 
over the past two years, including as part of the Cyber Security 
Strategy in the 2023 –24 MYEFO. Cyber security is an urgent national 
problem that touches the lives of every Australian, with one 
cybercrime reported every six minutes on average.  
Investments in the Department of Home Affairs, including the establishment of the 
National Cyber Security Coordinator, means the public service is able to work across 
the economy to manage and recover from major cyber incidents. Work is also 
underway to strengthen Australia ’s critical national infrastructure by working with 
industry, including telecom munication providers, hospitals and banks, to better 
protect infrastructure from attacks and make it more resilient.  
Additional investments in the Counter Foreign Interference Taskforce are 
supporting work to counter foreign interference in Australia, hel ping to disrupt 
foreign interference and espionage threats to Australians at home .

Preface   |  Page 15 
Investments in the public service have also supported the Government to better protect our 
environment, build disaster resilience and preparedness, and back our farmers.  
The 2024 –25 Budget includes further investments in the public service to secure the region, 
build resilience and protect Australians , including  investment in essential public service 
staff in the : 
• Australian Federal Police , for capabilities such as traini ng, cyber investigations and 
protective security services, including federal policing at Western Sydney International 
Airport  
• National Emergency Management Agency to ensure the Agency can continue to deliver 
on the Government ’s crisis management activities , including disaster resilience, 
preparedness and responding to communities in need  
• Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to support effective delivery of 
drought and climate resilience outcomes through the Future Drought Fund  
• Department of Cl imate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water  to sustain water 
policy functions  and to expand the oversight and independence functions of the 
Inspector -General of Water Compliance.

Investing in the public service  to manage the economic transformation  
The future made in Australia agenda lays the foundations of an ambitious strategy to 
secure the nation ’s future prosperity and resilience as we confront the challenges of the 
clean energy transition and emerging technologies.  
After a decade of delay and inaction on the clean energy transition, the Government has 
had to rebuild the public service ’s capability to manage the economic transformation 
required to effectively address climate change and deliver the required energy transition.  
Rebuilding  capability in the public service  to effectively 
address climate change  and support the energy transit ion 
After the 2022 election, the Government established the Department 
of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water —a 
department of state that was abolished by the previous  
Government. The Government has resourced the Department to play an importan t 
role in powering Australia with cheaper, cleaner and more reliable energy; with the 
public service playing a critical role in supporting the net zero industry and job 
creation. This includes introducing legislation to establish the Net Zero Economy  
Autho rity to help guide the net zero transformation. The Department has delivered 
significant policies and programs to drive Australian climate action, to transform our 
energy system to deliver cheaper, more reliable power, and to conserve, protect and 
sustaina bly manage our environment and water resources.  
Over successive Budgets, investments in the Department of Climate Change, Energy, 
the Environment and Water has enabled the Department to reduce its reliance on 
contractors from 22.5 per cent of the total wor kforce in September 2022 to 
10.6 per cent currently. Reliance on external consultancies by the Department has 
fallen by over 40 per cent in the first half of 2023 –24 compared to the same period 
in 2022–23.

Delivering the Nature Positive Plan  
The Governm ent’s investments in the Department of Climate 
Change, Energy, the Environment and Water have sped up 
environmental approval decisions under the Environmental 
Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 199 9, with 84  per cent of 
approvals considered withi n the statutory timeframe, up from 46 per cent on 
average under the previous  Government. Rebuilding the capacity of the public 
service will also facilitate renewable and clean energy projects.  
These investments are part of the Government ’s Nature Positive Plan, which also 
includes establishing an independent Environment Protection Australia to improve 
confidence in decision -making, and Environment Information Australia, to ensure 
high quality environmental data is available to facilitate timely and transparent 
decision -making.  
The 2024 –25 Budget makes further investments  in Australia ’s economic future , including  
investment in essential public service staff in:  
• the Department of Industry, Science and Resources and the Department of Climate 
Change, Energy, the Environment and Water to advance Australia ’s plans to become a 
renewable energy superpower, including expanding the Hydrogen Headstart program, 
delivering t he 2024 National Hydrogen Strategy and foundational and policy initiatives 
to expedite the development of Australia ’s green metals and critical minerals industries  
• the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water to implement 
priority r eforms to improve social licence for the energy transition and remove 
regulatory impediments for renewable energy projects   
• Geoscience Australia to provide specialised capabilities in pre -competitive geoscience 
data collection and analysis of ground water systems and resources to support increases 
in industry investment  
• the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and  the Department of Finance to support 
the establishment of a Domestic National Interest Account, to support, as required, 
investments consisten t with the future made in Australia agenda  
• the Department of the Treasury to coordinate the development of the future made in 
Australia legislation and associated policy frameworks, including a new National 
Interest Framework and Community Benefit Principl es. A Treasury taskforce will also 
lead consultation on a new ‘front door ’ for major projects, which will streamline how 
investors and business interact with the Government, helping them navigate approvals 
processes and fast -track major projects where poss ible.

Working for Australia  
The Government recognises that you cannot deliver outcomes for Australians without the 
foundations of a strong public service. After almost a decade of outsourcing, reduced 
service outcomes and underinvestment, the Government has invested in the public ser vice 
to ensure it is best placed to do the job the Australian people expect.  
The 2024 –25 Budget delivers cost -of-living help and builds a future made in Australia. The 
Budget  helps ease the pressures people are under today  and invests in a stronger and mo re 
resilient economy.  The Government remains committed to delivering quality services, 
securing our region, and building a stronger economy for all Australians.  
An appropriately -resourced public service is critical to delivering on the investments made 
in the 2024–25 Budget to grow Australia ’s future prosperity.

No. 4 
The purpose of Budget Paper No. 4 is to provide a whole of government view of estimated 
resourcing managed in the Budget year and previous year by agencies (which are non 
corporate Commonwealth entities, corporate Commonwealth entities and Commonwealth 
companies) in the General Government Sector (GGS). The resources include financial 
resources, staff resources, expenses and net capital investment.  
The Budget Papers do not authorise appropriations or impose legal obligations on the 
Commonwealth.  
Budget Paper  No. 4 contains three main parts and an appendix with tables of information 
as follows:  
Part 1  Agency Financial Resourcing  
1.1 Agency Resourcing Table  
1.2 Special Appropriations Table  
1.3 Special Accounts Table  
Part 2  Staffing of Agencies  
Part 3  Expenses a nd Net Capital Investment  
3.1 Departmental Expenses Table  
3.2 Net Capital Investment Table  
Appendix A: Agency Outcome Statements  
The Agency Financial Resourcing tables present appropriation information by portfolio 
and then by agency. Estimated resourcing is presented on a cash basis for both the Budget 
year and previous year (which is printed below the Budget year in italics, or to the left of 
the Budget year in a separate column). The tables include agencies, Outcomes, special 
appropriations an d special accounts, and estimates of annual appropriations and external 
revenue, as well as staffing for the 2023 –24 and 2024 –25 years.  
Estimates contained in the Budget Papers incorporate assumptions and judgements based 
on the best information available at the time of publication.     |  Budget Paper No. 4

Transfer of resourcing between agencies  
Agencies may, over the course of a financial year, transfer amounts of resourcing to other 
agencies, as a result of restructuring, legislative changes, Executive decisions and 
machinery o f government changes enacted by amendments to the Administrative 
Arrangements Order (AAO). Resourcing, at the date of change and afterwards, is reflected 
against the agency that gains the resources. Resourcing prior to the date of change is 
reflected again st the agency that formerly managed the resources.

 Guide to Resourcing Tables  
Linkages between tables and amounts presented in Budget Paper No. 4 are illustrated in 
Figures 1 to 4. A consolidated view of financial resources to be managed by agencies is 
presented in the Agency Resourcing Table. Amounts in the Agency Resourcing Table can 
be matched with information in the:  
• annual Appropriation Bills  
• Special Appropriations Table  
• Special Accounts Table.  
Figures 1 and 2 show how amounts  in the Agency Resourcing Table can be matched with 
amounts in the annual Appropriations Bills. The Figures also highlight amounts in these 
Bills for non -operating expenditure and for payments to the States, Territories and local 
governments.  
Figures 3 and  4 show how amounts in the Agency Resourcing Table can be matched with 
amounts in the Special Appropriations Table and the Special Accounts Table.

Appropriations Framework  
An appropriation is a legal entitlement to draw money from the Consolidated Revenue 
Fund (CRF). Appropriations are either annual appropriations or special appropriations. 
Annual appropriations are contained in the annual Appropriation Acts. Special 
appropriations are contained in other Acts.  
The CRF is a concept established in section  81 of the Constitution to represent all 
Commonwealth money. All revenues o r moneys raised or received by the Executive 
Government of the Commonwealth, or any person or organisation acting on behalf of the 
Commonwealth, automatically form part of the CRF. This includes for example taxes, 
charges, levies, borrowings, loan repaymen ts and moneys held on behalf of others or in 
trust. Money automatically forms part of the CRF upon receipt, regardless of whether the 
money is deposited in a bank account.  
Section 83 of the Constitution provides that no money shall be drawn from the Treasu ry of 
the Commonwealth except under an appropriation made by law (the ‘Treasury ’ of the 
Commonwealth equates to the CRF). Section  81 provides that appropriations from the CRF 
must be applied for expenditure of the Commonwealth. Together, sections  81 and 83 
provide that before money may be spent there must be an appropriation, made by law, for 
the purposes of the Commonwealth. These requirements for an appropriations framework 
safeguard the constitutional control by the Parliament over Australian  Government 
spending.  
The appropriations and expenditure framework for agencies in the Australian  Government 
is based on the accounting concept of control. Where an agency has substantial control, the 
related appropriation and expenditure is classified as departmental  and where an agency 
does not have control, expenditure is classified as administered . This classification is unique 
to government and is not used elsewhere in the Australian economy and is in accordance 
with the Australian Accounting Standard AASB 1050 Administered Items . Whether an 
agency has administered  or departmental  control over resources is based largely on the level 
of discretion the agency has in using those resources.  
Departmental  appropriations are available to meet expenditure over which an age ncy has 
substantial control and are typically used for agency operational expenditure, such as for 
employees and supplier expenses. Administered  appropriations are administered by an 
agency on behalf of the government for the benefit of, or payment to, par ties who are 
external to the agency and not part of the internal operations of that agency.  
Administered  appropriations are typically used for expenditure such as government 
grants, subsidies and obligations that arise from legislated eligibility rules and  conditions. 
Further information on the appropriations framework can be found on the Finance website.

Machinery of Government Changes  
The term ‘machinery of government changes ’ (MoG changes) describes a variety of 
organisational or functional changes aff ecting the Commonwealth. MoG changes often 
arise from amendments to the Administrative Arrangements Order (AAO) following a 
Prime Ministerial decision to abolish or create a department or to move functional 
responsibilities between agencies.  
Since the 202 3–24 Budget, there have been a number of AAO amendments and other 
Government decisions resulting in the following MoG changes:  
• establishment of the Australian Submarine Agency as a non -corporate Commonwealth 
entity in the Defence portfolio  
• establishment of the National  Anti -Corruption Commission as a non -corporate 
Commonwealth entity in the Attorney -General’s portfolio. The Australian Commission 
for Law Enforcement Integrity, formerly a non -corporate Commonwealth entity in the 
Attorney -General’s portfolio was abolished and its functions transferred to the National  
Anti -Corruption Commission  
• establishment of the Office of the Inspector -General of Aged Care as a non -corporate 
Commonwealth entity in the Health and Aged Care portfo lio 
• establishment of the Parliamentary Workplace Support Service as a non -corporate 
Commonwealth entity in the Finance portfolio  
• establishment of the High Speed Rail Authority as a corporate Commonwealth entity in 
the Infrastructure, Transport, Regional De velopment, Communications and the Arts 
portfolio. The High Speed Rail Authority adopted the functions of the National Faster 
Rail Agency, formerly a non-corporate Commonwealth entity in the same portfolio  
which was abolished  
• establishment of the National R econstruction Fund Corporation as a corporate 
Commonwealth entity in the Industry, Science and Resources portfolio  
• abolishment of the North Queensland Water Infrastructure Authority, a non -corporate 
Commonwealth entity in the Climate Change, Energy, the En vironment and Water 
portfolio

Advance to the Finance Minister  
The Advance to the Finance Minister (AFM) provisions under the annual Appropriation 
Acts enable urgently required allocations to be issued to entities during the financial year. 
Allocations are made through a determination by the Minister for Finance up to  a statutory 
limit in the annual Appropriation Acts.  
In 2023–24, AFM provisions totalling $1  billion were available across Appropriation Acts 
(Nos. 1 and 2)  2023–2024  for other urgent and unforeseen expenditure.  
At the time of publication, no AFMs have be en issued under the 2023 –24 annual 
appropriations.  
The Appropriation Bills (Nos. 1 and 2) 2024 –2025, once enacted, will include two AFM 
provisions totalling $1  billion, for urgent and unforeseen expenditure that is not currently 
contemplated, comprising:  
• $400  million in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2024 –2025  
• $600  million  in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2024 –2025.  
Further information on AFMs allocated in prior years can be found on the Finance website.

Overview of Agency Resourcing Table  
The Agency Resourcing  Table presents a consolidated view of estimated Commonwealth 
public sector financial resources, which will be managed in the Budget year by agencies, 
that is, Commonwealth entities and Commonwealth companies subject to the 
Public  Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 .4 The Agency Resourcing Table is 
organised by portfolio and agency, and by agency Outcome .5 Corporate Commonwealth 
entities are denoted by a * in the Agency Resourcing Table and Commonwealth companies 
are denoted b y a #.  
The Agency Resourcing Table differentiates the sources of funding, which are annual 
Appropriation Bills, External Revenue, Special Appropriations and Special Accounts. The 
amounts are classified into departmental  and administered  resourcing, except for special 
accounts, which can be classified as either or both. The Agency Resourcing Table includes 
inter -governmental transactions, which occur when one agency in the GGS pays another 
agency in the GGS for goods and/or services. To eliminate inter -gover nmental transactions 
would not accurately represent the financial resources managed by a particular agency.  
Amounts in the Agency Resourcing Table can be matched with amounts in the annual 
Appropriation Bills, Special Appropriations Table and Special Accou nts Table. Examples 
are in Figures 1 to 4 of the section entitled Guide to Resourcing Tables . 
Appropriations for corporate entities, shown as administered  in the annual Appropriation 
Bills, are regarded as departmental  funding when received by the corporat e entities. This is 
consistent with accounting and reporting requirements and shown as such in the Agency 
Resourcing Table.  
  
— 
4  The total amounts in the Agency Resourcing Table cannot be used to calculate consolidated 
Commonwealth financial resources. This is because they do not include Public Financial 
Corporations, Public Non -Financial  Corporations and the Australian National University. 
These are public corporations that typically operate in the commercial sphere, are not in the 
GGS, and are mostly self -funded. Further information on the nature and classification of 
agencies can be fou nd in the  Flipchart of PGPA Act Commonwealth entities and companies , which 
is available on the Finance website.  
5  The text of the approved Outcomes which apply to each agency is set out at Appendix A: 
Agency Outcome Statements .  
Budget  Paper No. 4   |   
 
Part 1: Agency Financial Resourcing   |  Page 33 
The column headed External Revenue  in the Agency Resourcing Table presents income 
received from sources that are not appropriated  by Parliament to the agency, including 
amounts received from other government agencies, individuals, and non -government 
bodies. In large part, these amounts are for the provision of services.  
The column headed Special Accounts in the Agency Resourcing Tab le shows estimated 
amounts to be credited to one or more special accounts. This column presents estimated 
income expected from other government agencies, individuals and non -government 
bodies. This column is located between the departmental  and administere d sides of the 
Agency Resourcing Table because depending on the legislated purposes of a special 
account, the resources may be used for departmental  and/or administered  expenditure. It is 
consistent with amounts presented in the Receipts (non -appropriated)  column of the Special 
Accounts Table.  
The Agency Resourcing Table includes only those special appropriations and special 
accounts that have been established in law at the time of publication. The Agency 
Resourcing Table and Special Accounts Table exclude  moneys held by an agency on trust 
for a person other than the Commonwealth. These amounts are not considered resourcing 
available to the agency, as they are not held on account of the Common wealth and are not 
for the use or benefit of the Commonwealth.

d) The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) is a corporate Commonwealth entity and as such is not required to report expe nses separately as 
administered  or departmental . However, the NDIA ’s expenses incurred in the provision of reasonable and necessary  support to clients ( administered  in nature) 
will be significant over the forward estimates compared to other corporate Commonwealth entities. These expenses are jointly funded by the Commonwealth 
and participating States and Territories and reflected as D epartmental External Revenue. All agency operational costs ( departmental  in nature) are funded by 
the Commonwealth through the Appropriation Bills. Table  3.1: Departmental Expenses Table also shows the split between NDIA expenses that are 
departmental  or administered  in nature and provides a total excluding NDIA expenses that are administered  in nature.

Special Appropriations  Table  
Overview of the Special Appropriations  Table  
The Special Appropriations Table lists Acts that contain one or more special 
appropriations. Acts are listed by portfolio and responsible agency, consistent with the 
most recent AAO.  
Special appropriations are those appropriations contained in Acts other than the annual 
Appropriation Acts.  
Special appropriations can be limited or unlimited in terms of amount or time. A small 
number of Acts may also stipulate a maximum amount appropriated for the particular 
purpose. Expenditure funded by a special appropri ation is often triggered by legislative 
eligibility criteria and conditions. An example of expenditure that is met using a special 
appropriation is aged pensions paid under the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 . 
The Summary of Special Appropriation s Table presents total portfolio resourcing that is 
supported by special appropriations. Only those special appropriations that have been 
established in law at the time of publication are included in the Special Appropriations 
Table and Summary of Special Appropriations Table.  
The detailed Special Appropriations Table presents estimated resourcing required for each 
agency by Act that is supported by special appropriations. For each agency, the aggregated 
total for all Acts in the Special Appropriations Tabl e can be matched with the total Special 
Appropriation  amount in the Agency Resourcing Table. For an example of this matching, 
see Figure 3 of the Guide to Resourcing Tables  section. Where no resourcing is expected to be 
required during the Budget or compar ator year, the relevant Acts have not been included 
in the Special Appropriations Table.  
A complete list of Acts with provisions containing special appropriations can be found in 
the Chart of Special Appropriations , which is available on the Finance websit e.   |  Budget Paper No. 4

Special Accounts Table   |  Page 137 
Special A ccounts Table  
Overview of the Special Accounts Table  
A special account is an appropriation mechanism that sets aside an amount within the 
CRF  for specific expenditure purposes. Special accounts can be used to appropriate for 
expenditure that is resourced from contributions from other parties, such as other 
governments, contributions from industry or members of the community. Special accounts 
can also be credited with amounts from annual appropriations and speci al appropriations 
(including other special accounts), if those amounts were appropriated for the same 
purpose as the special account. Special accounts can be credited with amounts held on 
trust  – these amounts are not shown in the Special Accounts Table as  they are not 
considered resourcing available to the agency.  
The Summary of Special Accounts Table presents total portfolio resourcing that is expected 
to be provided by other agencies, individuals and non -government bodies.  
The Special Accounts Table list s special accounts by portfolio and responsible agency. For 
each special account, the Special Accounts Table shows the estimated opening balance for 
the Budget and comparator years, estimated cash inflows and outflows (receipts and 
payments) during the yea r, and estimated closing balance at the end of the Budget and 
comparator years. Estimated resources for the comparator year are printed in italics. Where 
responsibility for managing a special account is moved between agencies during the year, 
the part year  impact for each agency is shown.  
The column headed Receipts  (Non -Appropriated)  shows estimated amounts to be credited 
to a special account, which are received from other agencies, individuals, and  
non-government bodies. The column headed Receipts  (Appropr iated)  shows amounts 
estimated to be credited to a special account, which are appropriated to the agency in an 
annual Appropriation  Act or another Act containing a special appropriation (including 
other special accounts).  
Amounts for an agency in the Speci al Accounts Table column headed 
Receipts  (Non -Appropriated)  can be matched with the Agency Resourcing Table column 
headed Special  Accounts . Amounts in the Special Accounts Table column headed 
Receipts  (Appropriated)  are included in the Agency Resourcing Table in the column(s) 
headed Appropriation Bill No.  1, Appropriation  Bill No. 2 and/or Special  Appropriation . 
Further  detail on matching amounts between these two tables is in Figure 4 of the Guide to 
Resourcing  Tables  section.  
Special accounts which had no  balance, receipts or payments during the Budget or 
comparator years are not included in the Special Accounts Table. A list of current special 
accounts can be found in the Chart of Special Accounts , which is available on the Finance 
website .

Part 2: Staffing of Agencie s 
 
Staffing of Agencies   |  Page 169 Estimates of Average Staffing Levels of Agencies in the 
Australian General Government Sector  
This Part reports on Average Staffing Levels (ASL) at the portfolio and agency level. Data is 
presented for two years – the Budget year (20 24–25) and the preceding year (2023 –24). The 
ASL reported is updated from the 2023 –24 Budget.  
Data  for 2024–25 reported in Table  2.2 represent estimates of ASL provided by general 
government sector (GGS) agencies. ASL figures reflect the average number of employees 
receiving salary or wages over the financial year, with adjustments for casual and part -time 
employees to show the full time equivalent. It also includes uniformed employees and 
overseas personnel. The ASL figures exclude external labour. Any minor discrepancies in 
totals are due to rounding of partial ASL.  
Data for 2023 –24 reported in Table  2.2 represent the updated estimated ASL outcomes for 
GGS agencies. Caution should be taken when comparing these estimates  with estimates 
from other years (in this Budget or previous budgets). Actual ASL outcomes realised by 
agencies can differ to earlier e stimates  provided by agencies.  
The staffing of agencies  in 20 23–24 and 20 24–25 
At the 2024 –25 Budget a cross the GGS (excluding military and reserves):  
• The estimated ASL figure for 2024 –25 is 20 9,150. This change in estimated ASL 
compared to the 2023–24 ASL estimate reflects the Government ’s decisions since the 
2023–24 Budget and the conversion of external labour to ASL positions.  
• The estimated ASL figure for 2023 –24 is 19 7,108 which is 5, 248 above the estimated level 
(191,861) at the time of the  2023–24 Budget.  
Estimated ASL in 2024 –25 shows that in this Budget the  Government has made significant 
investments in frontline service delivery capacity and capability. This includes resourcing 
for Services Australia, the Department of Veterans ’ Affairs  (DVA), the National Disability 
Insurance Agency (NDIA) and the Australian Taxation Office. The Government has also 
invested in the resources needed to deliver the future made in Australia agenda and 
support Australia ’s energy transition, as well as secure  the region, build resilience and 
protect Australians.  
Estimated ASL in 2023–24 represents the significant investment in staffing in 2023 –24 
to rebuild service delivery capacity and capability , along with additional contractor 
conversions since the 2023 –24 Budget . This includes resources for Services Australia to 
remediate the impacts of under -resourcing and reduce backlogs, and  for the Department 
of Home Affairs to improve visa processing capabilities and speed up wait times.    |  Budget Paper No. 4  
 
Page 170  |  Staffing of Agencies  
Measuring the size of the public service  
In addition to the ASL estimates published each year in Budget Paper No.  4, the 
Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) and the Australian Bureau of 
Statistics (ABS) also publish estimates of the size of the public service. These are 
not directly comparable.  
• ASL reported in Budget Paper No. 4 is the average number of full -time 
equivalent employees, adjusted for work hours per  person, who receive salary 
or wages, by General Government Sector (GGS) agencies. It includes those 
employed outsi de the Public Service Act 1999 . 
• The APSC measures the number of ongoing and non ongoing employees, not 
adjusted for work hours per person, employed under the Public Service Act  1999  
at a particular point in time, typically 30  June or 31  December each year.  
• The ABS measures the number of employees, not adjusted for work hours 
per person, engaged by the Australian  Government . It includes Defence 
personnel and those employed outside the Public Service Act  1999  who are paid 
over one month, typically the month o f June each year.

Reducing  reliance on contractors , consultants and external labour hire  
In this Budget, the Government has continued to reduce  its reliance on contractors, 
consultants and external labour hire (collectively known as external labour). Consistent 
with the Government ’s election commitment  and the  APSC’s Strategic Commissioning 
Framework,  the Government has reported additional conversion s of more than 2, 500 roles 
undertaken by external labour to ASL in 2024 –25 (see Table  2.1). This represents a further 
rebalancing of the APS workforce to reduce the reliance on external  labour where the work 
can appropriately be done by APS staff.   
This is  in addition to the 3,314 conversions reported in the 2023 –24 Budget and the 
3,000  roles in Services Australia that are now being done by public servants instead of 
through outsourced arrangements.

 Expenses and Net Capital Investment   |  Page 185 Part 3: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  
This part reports on departmental expenses and net capital in vestment, by agency. The data 
is presented on the same basis as data in Statement 6 of Budget Paper No. 1. Both sets of 
data are presented on the basis of external accounting and financial reporting standards. 
These standards present information in terms o f accrued expenses and accrued revenue.  
The external standards used for budget reporting purposes are:  
• the Australian Bureau of Statistics ’ accrual  Government Finance Statistics (GFS) 
publication, Australian System of Government Finance Statistics: Concepts, Sources and 
Methods,  2015  (cat no. 5514.0), which is based on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
accrual GFS framework  
• the Australian Accounting Standards, issued by the Australian Accounting Standards 
Board (AASB), which includes International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
in Australia for use by the not-for-profit  sector and specific standards such as 
AASB  1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting  
(AASB  1049).  
Machinery of government changes have implications for how information is presented in 
the tables in this part. For example, if an agency was abolished in a particular year, it will 
have estimated expenses reflecting expenditure in part of that year. If an agency was 
created in a particular year, it will have estimated expenses for both that year and 
forward  years.

Page 186  |  Expenses and Net Capital Investment  
Departmental Expenses Table  
Table  3.1 presents departmental expenses by agency. Departmental expenses reduce the net 
worth of agencies. It includes expenses  controlled by agencies such as payment of wages 
and purchases of goods and services. It excludes administered expenses – not controlled by 
agencies  – paid on behalf of government such as social benefits and grants to the States. 
It also excludes net capit al investment, which does not reduce net worth.

• to measure and assess non -financial performance in contributing to Government 
policy  objectives.  
• This appendix contains approved Outcome statements for GGS agencies. It does not 
include agencies tha t are not within the GGS, such as Public Financial Corporations or

Easing cost -of-living 
pressures  
Taking pressure off Australians  
 
Many Australians are under pressure from the 
cost of living. That’s why  the Government is 
delivering tax  cuts for all  Australian taxpayers 
from  1 July 2024 . In addition  to these tax cuts, 
this Budget delivers a further $7.8 billion in 
cost-of-living relief.  
This Budget build s on the Government’s initiatives 
to provide  cheaper child  care , cheaper medicines, 
increase d bulk billing incentives , energy bill relief,  
boost working age payments , student payments  
and Commonwealth Rent Assistance , and expand 
eligibility for the Parenting Payment (Single). 
In this Budget , the Government is provid ing 
more  support for Australians doing  it tough.  
Tax cuts for every taxpayer  
The Government has legislated  tax cuts for all 
13.6  million Australian taxpayers from 1  July 2024 . 
These tax cuts  provide cost -of-living relief , 
return  bracket cree p, support women , and 
boost  labour  supply . 
On average, taxpayers will receive a tax cut 
of $1,888  or $36 per week, in 2024 –25. 
By 2034–35, someone earning an average 
income  will pay $21, 915 less tax.  
Compared to previously legislated setting s, 
11.5  million Australian taxpayers (84  per cent  of 
taxpayers ) will receive a bigger tax  cut, delivering  
meaningful cost -of-living relief to middle Australia  
without adding to inflationary press ures .  This includes 2.9  million  low-income taxpayers 
with taxable income of $45,000 or less, who would 
not have received any support , and  5.8 million 
women (90  per cent of women taxpayers) who  
will receive a bigger tax  cut. 
The Government ’s tax cuts provide taxpayers, 
particularly low - and middle -income taxpayers, 
with greater protection against bracket creep and 
support the progressivity of Australia ’s tax system.  
Increasing Medicare levy low -income thresholds  
The Government has increased the Medicare levy 
low-income thresholds for 2023 –24, ensuring 
more than one million low -inco me taxpayers 
continue to be exempt from the Medicare levy 
or pay a reduced levy rate.   
New power bill relief  
The Government is providing $ 3.5 billion of 
energy  bill relief , to all households and eligible 
small  businesses . From 1 July 2024, more than 
ten million households will receive rebates 
of $300  on their energy bills , while around 
one million small businesses will receive $325 .   
 | Easing cost -of-living pressures  2 
Boosting Commonwealth Rent Assistance  
The Government is increasing maximum rates of 
Commonwealth Rent Assistance by a further 
10 per cent at a cost of $1.9 billion over five  years. 
This builds on the 15 per cent increase in the last 
Budget and will take maximum rates over 40  per 
cent higher than in May 2022 – a combined  result 
of indexation and the actions of the Government. 
Nearly 1 million households will benefit.  
Cheaper medicines  
The Government is working to finalise an Eighth 
Community Pharmac y Agreement, supported by 
up to $3 billion in additional funding. This will 
deliver cheaper medicines, improve health 
outcomes and secure a strong community 
pharmacy sector. As part o f the Agreement , 
instead of rising with inflation, med icines will 
be kept cheaper  through  temporary freeze s 
on the maximum  patient  co-payment .  
Debt relief for students  
The Government will cap indexation of Higher 
Education Loan Program (HELP) and other student 
loan debts to the lower of the Consumer Price 
Index or Wage Price Index, so growth in debt 
does  not outpace wages growth. The change in 
indexation will be retroactively applied from 
1 June  2023  and will cut debts by $3 billion 
for 3 million Australians . 
Support ing students during study  
More than 73,000 eligible nursing,  midwifery , 
teaching and social work students per year will 
receive a Commonwealth Prac Payment of 
$319.50  per week for the duration of their 
placement. This will help to alleviate the 
significant  financial impact of mandatory 
placements and increase retention in courses for 
careers in sectors experiencing shortages.  
Additional fee -free TAFE places  
The Government will invest $ 88.8  million over 
three years from 2024 –25 to deliver 20,000 new 
Fee-Free TAFE places, including increased access 
to pre -apprenticeship programs in courses 
relevant to the construction sector.  Freezing social security deeming rates  
The Government is supporting social security 
recipients t o manage cost of living pressures 
by freezing social security deeming rates for 
financial  investments at their current levels 
until  30 June  2025. This will benefit around 
876,000  income support recipients, including 
around 450,000  Age Pensioners.  
A fair go at the checkout  
The Government recognises that the cost of living 
is putting many family budgets under significant 
pressure, including the cost of food and groceries. 
The Government has:  
• directed t he ACCC to undertake a 12 -month 
inquiry into the supermarket sector , 
• commissioned Dr  Craig Emerson to review 
the Food and Grocery Code , and 
• funded consumer organisation CHOICE to 
publish quarterly supermarket price 
transparency and comparison reports.  
Superannuation on Government -funded PPL  
In recognition of the important contribution 
parents make, the Government is spending  
$1.1 billion to pay superannuation on 
Government -funded Paid Parental Leave (PPL)  
for parents of babies born or adopted on or 
after  1 July 2025.   
Targeted support for JobSeeker  Payment 
recipient s with a  partial capacity to work  
The Government is  providing  $41. 2 million over 
five years to  extend eligibility for the existing 
higher rate of the JobSeeker Payment . This will 
provide a boost of at least $54.90  per fortnight to 
eligible recipients with a partial capacity to work of 
zero  to 14 hours per week . 
Boosting support for Australians facing acute 
and urgent cost -of-living pressures  
The Government will provide $138.0 million 
over  five years  to meet high demand for crisis 
support including emergency relief . The Financial 
Wellbeing and Capability Activity  program 
supports over 580,000 clients, of which over 
60 per cent are women .

A Future Made in Australia  
 
This Budget invests $22. 7 billion over  the next 
decade to build a Future Made in Australia. This 
plan is about maximising the economic and 
industrial benefit s of the move to net zero and 
securing Australia ’s place in a changing global 
economic and strategic landscape.  
The global environment is changing  rapidly. Supply 
chains are under pressure, with increasing  
fragmentation and intensifying global competition.  
New opportunities in clean energy industries are 
also emerging that will shape the future of the 
global economy over the next decade and beyond.  
Given our critical and abundant natural 
endowments and skilled workforce, Australia is 
well positioned to strengthen priority supply 
chains and become an indispensable part of the 
net zero global economy.  
The Government ’s plan for a Future Made in 
Austra lia is central to this transformation. It is 
focused on encouraging and facilitating the private 
sector investment needed to make the most of 
this opportunity.  
The plan will help build a stronger, more 
diversified and more resilient economy powered 
by cle an energy, in a way that creates secure, 
well-paid jobs and delivers benefits to 
communities across the country.  The plan for a Future Made in Australia is about:  
• Attracting and enabling investment   
• Making Australia a renewable energy 
superpower  
• Value add ing to our resources and 
strengthening economic security  
• Backing Australian ideas: innovation, 
digital,  science  
• Investing in people and places  
As part of this plan, the Government will create 
a Future Made in Australia Act  and establish  a 
National Interest  Framework to guide the 
identification of priority industries and prudent 
investments in the national interest . 
National Interest Framework   
The new National Interest Framework  imposes 
rigour on Government ’s decision making on 
significant public investments, particularly those 
used to incentivise private investment at scale.  
Through the Framework, priority industries will be 
identified under two streams. The ‘net zero 
transformation ’ stream will identify industries that 
can make a significant cont ribution to achieving 
net zero, where Australia has grounds to build 
enduring comparative advantage.    |  A Future Made in Australia  2 
The ‘economic security and resilience ’ stream will 
identify sectors that are critical to our resilience, 
are vulnerable to supply disruptions and that 
require support to unlock sufficient private 
investment.  
In the 2024 –25 Budget, five industries  are aligned 
with  the National Interest Framewor k: 
• Renewable  hydrogen  
• Critical minerals processing  
• Green metals  
• Low carbon  liquid fuels  
• Clean energy  manufacturing, including battery 
and solar panel  supply chains  
The Government will also apply community 
benefit principles to investments in priority 
indus tries, with a focus on investment in local 
communities, supply chains and skills, and 
promoting diverse workforces and secure jobs.  
This Budget invests significantly in these areas, 
through targeted support for early -stage 
innovation, financing, production and by 
improving investment enablers . 
In addition, Export Finance Australia ’s National 
Interest Account will be expanded to allow 
support for projects where domestic capability is 
critical to protect our national security interests, 
strengthen r esilience or ensure our nation is 
sufficiently resilient to shocks. Investments will be 
guided by the National Interest Framework . 
Given the pace of technological change, the 
Government will regularly review the list of 
priority industries against the Nati onal Interest 
Framework to ensure support remains fit for 
purpose in a changing world .  
Net zero transformation  stream  
Renewable hydrogen  
Renewable hydrogen is a game changer, and the 
flagship of the net zero transformation stream. 
It opens the door to gre en metals, such as iron, 
steel, alumina and aluminium, and other 
applications critical to industrial decarbonisation.  Our world class renewable energy resources make  
Australia well placed to produce green hydrogen  
at internationally competitive prices.  Additionally, 
Australia is close to key markets, and our major 
trading partners have expressed a significant 
appetite for importing renewable hydrogen.   
Green Metals  
Significant quantities of green iron, steel, alumina 
and aluminium will be required to  support the 
energy transition, globally and domestically. Both 
steel and aluminium are used in  wind turbines, 
electric vehicles and grid infrastructure.  However, 
traditional metals production is highly carbon 
intensive.  Australia can develop a long -term 
comparative advantage in green metals by 
drawing on our abundant metal and  renewable 
energy resources .  
Low carbon liquid  fuels  
Sustainable aviation and diesel  fuels will play a key 
role as the global and Australian economies 
transition to net zero, offering  a decarbonisation 
pathway for many hard -to-abate sectors, including 
aviation, shipping and heavy  transport.  
Australia’s large landmass, advanced farming 
practices, access to renewable feedstocks, 
established supply chains and renewable energy 
potential ar e all assets in developing domestic 
production of low carbon liquid fuels . 
Economic resilience  and 
security  stream  
Critical minerals   
Critical minerals are the building -blocks for a range 
of important sectors such as clean energy  
manufacturing , transport, agri -tech, medicine, 
defence, space, computing  and 
telecommunications .    |  A Future Made in Australia  3 
Under scenarios that achieve net zero emissions 
by 2050, global demand for critical minerals is 
expected to increase by around 350  per cent by 
2040 . Australia is in a strong position to supply 
these minerals, with some of the world ’s largest 
reserves of lithium, cobalt and rare earths . 
Refining and processing critical minerals here will 
allow us to move along global supply chains to 
capture more of the  value and contribute to 
creating more diverse, resilient and sustainable 
global supply chains.  
Clean energy manufacturing  
Clean energy technologies are critical inputs to 
Australia’s energy transition. Global supply chains 
for certain clean energy techno logies are highly 
concentrated, especially for solar panels and 
batteries. This increase s Australia’s vulnerability to 
a disruption in supply, which could pose significant 
risks to Australia ’s economic resilience.   
Along with other policy actions such as 
international partnerships and market facilitation, 
scaling -up Australia ’s clean energy manufacturing 
will assist in strengthening our clean energy supply 
chains.  
Australia can contribute to the diversification of 
global solar and battery supply chains by 
harnessing our strengths in research and 
development , renewable energy  and critical 
minerals , and investing in the areas of supply 
chains where we are most competitive .  
Strengthening our policy toolkit  
This Framework helps Government identify 
prudent inve stments in the national interest. 
It complements broader policy initiatives that 
boost productivity and economic growth. The 
Government will continue to apply other policy 
frameworks to promote Australia ’s economic 
security and prosperity.  For example, th e Government will continue to 
invest in emerging critical technologies which 
create opportunities to transform a wide range of 
sectors across the economy. The Critical 
Technologies Statement  prioritises action on 
artificial intelligence, robotics and autom ation, 
and quantum technologies among other fields .  
The Government will also continue to take direct 
action to build domestic industrial capacity for key 
defence technologies and capabilities , and support 
broader industrial priorities, including the prior ity 
areas of the National Reconstruction Fund . 
Attracting  and enabling 
investment  
The Government is reforming investment settings , 
institutions  and regulatory processes  to attract 
and enable the investment Australia needs . 
New front door  for investors  
The Government will establish a new front door  
for investors with major, transformational 
investment proposals related to the Government ’s 
Future Made in Australia agenda to make it 
simpler to invest in Australia and attract more 
global and  domestic capital . The front door  will:  
• provide a single point of contact for investors 
and companies with major investment 
proposals,  
• deliver a joined -up approach to investment 
attraction and facilitation,  
• identify priority projects related to the 
Gover nment’s Future Made in Australia 
agenda , 
• support accelerated and coordinated approval  
decisions , and ,  
• connect investors with the Government ’s 
specialist investment vehicles .  
The front door will  complement and leverage 
existing institutions , including  the Net Zero 
Economy Authority . The final approach to 
delivering an effective front door will be 
developed in consultation with investors,   |  A Future Made in Australia  4 
businesses, governments, unions, communities, 
and other experts over the course of 2024 .  
Strengthening  and streamlining  approvals  
The Government is making it easier to invest in 
transformational projects  by streamlining approval 
processes in ways that strengthen  standards .  
The Government is provid ing $134.2 million to 
better prioritise approvals for renewable energy 
projects of national significance, and support 
faster decisions on environment, cultural heritage 
and planning approvals . This investment delivers 
more support for assessments across approval 
processes so we  can reduce delays for projects 
and provide greater certainty for businesses .  
The Government is also committing $20.7 million 
to improve engagement with communities 
involved in the energy transition and accelerate 
the delivery of key energy projects, thro ugh a 
bolstered Australian Energy Infrastructure 
Commissioner and voluntary national developer 
standards. This will complement initiatives with 
states and territories to improve planning and 
energy grid connection approval processes . 
To further encourage i nvestment, the Government 
will provide $15.7 million to deliver a stronger, 
more  streamlined , and more transparent approach 
to foreign investment . This will ensure that 
Australia can attract the significant foreign capital 
flows we need , while protecting t he national 
interest in an increasingly complex economic 
and geostrategic environment . 
Promoting sustainable  finance  
The Government is committing $ 17.3  million to 
implement a comprehensive agenda to mobilise 
private investment in sustainable activities.  
The Budget provides funding to extend Australia ’s 
sustainable finance taxonomy to the agriculture 
sector and develop an investment product 
labelling regime for financial products  marketed as 
sustainable . Additionally, the Government will 
explore data quali ty improvements and provide 
$1.3  million to develop and release best practice 
guidance for disclosing net zero transition plans.  These initiatives complement the Government ’s 
climate disclosure legislation and the forthcoming 
issuance of $7 billion in gre en bonds in 2023 –24. 
Making Australia a renewable 
energy superpower  
Australia’s ambition to become a renewable 
energy superpower is foundational to the 
Government ’s broader plan for a future made in 
Australia. The Government is taking decisive steps 
to pro mote private investment in priority 
industries by supporting innovation, financing 
and production.  
Innovation  
The Government is investing $3.2 billion over the 
next decade through the Australian Renewable 
Energy Agency to support the commercialisation 
of technologies that are critical to the net zero 
transformation. The new $1.7 billion Future Made 
in Australia Innovation Fund will fund the 
deployment of innovative technologies and 
facilities linked directly to priority industries, 
including green metals an d low carbon liquid fuels . 
Financing  
The Government will work with the 
Commonwealth ’s specialist investment vehicles, 
including the Clean Energy Finance Corporation 
and the National Reconstruction Fund, to ensure 
coordinated investment on critical governme nt 
priorities. Investments from these entities can help 
reduce barriers to investment by de -risking 
projects and reducing upfront capital costs .  
Production  
This Budget includes targeted production 
incentives to scale up priority industries: aligning 
incentives to invest with the national interest, 
targeting ‘green premiums ’ that are not yet 
reflected in market prices, and investing efficiently 
in mitigating t he risks of excess supply chain 
concentration.  
Support for production is being delivered over 
timeframes that promote accelerated investment   |  A Future Made in Australia  5 
over the next decade, and in ways that are 
contingent on successful production.  
The Hydrogen Production Tax Incent ive will 
provide a $2 incentive per kilogram of renewable 
hydrogen produced for up to ten years per project, 
between 2027 –28 and 2039 –40 for projects that 
reach final investment decisions by 2030. This will 
operate alongside the expanded Hydrogen 
Headstart  program, which supports the early 
movers investing in the industry ’s development in 
a way that complements the support provided 
through the tax system.  
Details of these programs are subject to 
consultation, alongside proposals to provide 
further incentiv es to support efficient production 
of green metals and low carbon liquid fuels . 
Guarantee of origin  
The Government is making it easier for businesses 
and trading partners to source low -emissions 
products by building better markets and product 
standards for  green products .  
The Guarantee of Origin scheme will measure and 
certify the emissions intensity across the supply 
chain of key products. The Budget provides 
$32.2  million to fast-track the initial phase of this 
scheme, focused on renewable hydrogen, and 
support the expansion of the program to green 
meals and low  carbon liquid fuels . 
Cheaper, cleaner energy   
Delivering on Australia ’s potential to produce 
abundant renewable energy is essential to 
realising the industrial opportunities associated 
with cheape r, cleaner energy .  
The Government will unlock over $65 billion of 
renewable energy capacity through the Capacity 
Investment Scheme. This investment will translate 
Australia’s natural advantages into reality and 
transform the electricity grid for an econom y 
powered by renewables.  
This Budget also helps Australians benefit from 
cheaper, cleaner energy sooner by committing 
$27.7 million to better integrate consumer energy 
resources, such as rooftop solar, household 
batteries and electric vehicles, into the grid .  Securing the net zero transformation  
The Government is developing six sector plans 
covering electricity and energy, transport, 
industry, resources, agriculture and land, and the 
built environment. The sector plans will guide 
decarbonisation efforts and outline the role of 
each sector in supporting Australia ’s transition 
to net zero . 
This Budget continues the Government ’s 
investment in emissions abatement, including 
$63.8 million to reduce emissions in the 
agriculture and land sector . 
Value  adding to resources and 
strengthening economic  security  
The Budget boosts economic resilience and 
security including by shoring up and diversifying 
supply chains. It does this by value -adding to our 
resources, investing in critical minerals p rojects, 
supporting clean energy manufacturing and 
advancing trade initiatives.  
The Critical Minerals Production Tax Incentive will 
provide a production incentive valued at 
10 per cent of relevant processing and refining 
costs for Australia ’s 31 critical minerals. This 
incentive will be applicable for up to 10 years per 
project, for production between 2027 –28 and 
2039–40 by projects that reach final investment 
decisions by 2030 .  
The Government is also investing in priority critical 
minerals projects, incl uding through  the Critical 
Minerals Facility and the Northern Australia 
Infrastructure Facility. This will complement the 
Critical Minerals National Productivity Initiative 
which provides $10 million to work in partnership 
with states and territories to de velop 
pre-feasibility studies of common -user 
infrastructure, which promotes a competitive 
and productive critical minerals sector . 
The Government is making targeted investments 
in clean energy technology manufacturing 
capabilities, focused on the aspects o f highly 
concentrated critical energy supply chains that 
best align with Australia ’s comparative advantages 
and capabilities. This includes the $1  billion Solar   |  A Future Made in Austr alia 6 
Sunshot and $523.2 million  in support for the 
Battery Breakthrough Initiative . 
To support the d elivery of the 82 per cent 
renewable energy target, the Government has 
formed the National Renewable Energy Supply 
Chain Action Plan with states and territories which 
will strengthen supply chains of key inputs 
required for clean energy . 
The Government is also progressing trade 
initiatives to address global market competition 
and support critical minerals trade enhancement .  
Backing  Australian ideas – 
innovation, digital  and science  
Modern science, innovation and investments in 
technology will be critical to maximising the 
opportunities of a changing global economic and 
strategic landscape , including the net zero 
transformation . 
Building on Australia ’s existing strengths in 
research and applied technology, the Government 
is investing $466.4 million  to build quantum 
computing capabilities, in partnership with the 
Queensland Government and PsiQuantum . 
The Government is also investing $566 million in 
open science by supporting Geoscience Australia 
to map Australia ’s endowments of critical minerals 
and national groundwater systems . 
To grow our core science and innovation 
capability, the Government will undertake a 
strategic examination of Australia ’s research and 
development (R&D) system . 
Investing in people and places  
Investing in people and places is c entral to the 
Government ’s Future Made in Australia plan . This 
Budget makes important investments in skills, 
training and education and provides support for 
communities and regions that are most impacted 
by the net zero transformation .  
Investing in people  
The Government is investing $ 91.0  million over the 
next five years to accelerate the development of the clean energy workforce through expanded

The Hon Julie Collins  MP  
Minister for Small Business  
May  2024  
 Easing the pressure on small 
business es 
The Government is making it easier for small 
businesses to do business, by delivering supports 
and reforming regulatory settings in a way that 
considers the burden and costs for small business 
owners.  
These support s are vital for small business  owners 
to prepare for, manage and remain resilient to 
large shocks , such as natural disasters, as well as 
the day -to-day stress ors of running a small 
business.  
Supporting mental health and financial 
wellbeing  
The Government recognises that small business 
owners face unique  challenges , with their mental 
health connected to the financial health of their 
small business.  
This Budget invests a further $ 10.8 million to 
support the mental health and financial wellbeing 
of small business owners by:  
• extending the NewAccess for Small Business 
Owners program , which provides tailored, 
free and confidential mental health support 
to small business owners  
• extending  the Small Business Debt Helpline,

Strategy. Working together with the states and 
territories, the Government aims to drive a 
coordinated and cohesive national approach  to 
small business supports and reforms.

the impacts of violence against women, including sexual  assault, as well as issues such as 
suicide , self-harm , stillbirth,  and miscarriage . The Government respectfully acknowledges 
and regrets the loss of those who have died and the harm and distress caused to those who

Note about data  
This Statement endeavours to include data and analysis to demonstrate the outcomes 
experienced by different groups of women, including Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander 
women, culturally and linguistically diverse  communities , women with disability, women 
of different ages, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual or other 
sexually or gender d iverse (LGBT IQA+) populations. There are, however, limitations to 
data in some cases, particularly small population or sample sizes. The Government is 
committed to ensuring data  are available to help inform better outcomes for all Australians, 
noting that this needs to be culturally appropriate and protect the right to privacy.  
This Statement uses unit record data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in 
Australia (HILDA) Survey. The HILDA Project was initiated and is funded by the 
Australian Gove rnment Department of Social Services (DSS) and is managed by the 
Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research (Melbourne Institute). 
The findings and views reported in this Statement , however, are those of the Government

The majority of the data collected and reported in this Statement relate to sex, not gender. 
Sex is based upon the person’s sex characteristics, such as their chromosomes, hormones 
and reproductive organs . Gender is a social and cultural concept. It is about social and 
cultural differences in identity, expression and experience as a man, woman or  
non-binary person. This Statement uses the terms women  and men in reference to both sex 
and gender, but the terms female  and male  are used when presenting data collected on the 
basis of sex.

To achieve an Australia where people are safe, treated with respect, have choices and have access to 
resources and equal outcomes no matter their gender, women and gender equality must be at the 
centre of Australia’s economic plan.  
Equality for women in every part of ou r economy and society is central to our 
Government’s plans for the future – because it is essential for Australia’s success in the 
future. The Women’s Budget Statement speaks for the progress we have made so far and 
the determination we hold to go further.  
This Budget Statement reflects the values and priorities of our Government. It is about 
education and employment, fair pay and respectful workplaces, the chance to be your best 
and the right to be safe wherever you are – at home, at work or in the communi ty.  
It is about drawing on the talents of our whole population. Fundamentally, it is about who 
we are as Australians.  
This year, the Albanese Government launched our country’s first national strategy with an 
explicit focus on achieving gender equality. Working for Women: A Strategy for Gender 
Equality (Working for Women ) is this Government’s  ten-year commitment to shift t he dial on 
gender equality for everyone, and to get things working for women in Australia.  
Since day one, women’s safety and women’s equality have been at the centre of this 
Government’s thinking and decision -making. The links between gender inequality, 
financial insecurity and women’s safety are clear, and we cannot have an equal society until 
women and children are safe. Working for Women  sets out our ambitious agenda to drive 
lasting change over the next ten years, with a commitment to support people fro m all 
backgrounds and life experiences. It has five priority areas: gender -based violence; unpaid 
and paid care; economic equality and security; health; and leadership, representation and 
decision -making.  
Our nation has been rightly horrified by the shocki ng acts of gender -based violence 
committed by men against women and children this year . The devastating truth is that 
these abuses are not new but  a continuation of the crisis of violence faced by women in this 
country , and around the world. We need change . The Government is taking urgent action 
through the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children 2022 –2032  to address 
the epidemic rates of violence in Australia.  
This Budget, the Government is permanently establishing ongoing financial suppo rt 
through the Leaving  Violence Program for victim -survivors leaving a violent intimate 
partner relationship. The Government is also responding to high rates of sexual violence on 
university campuses including through a National Higher Education Code to Pr event and 
Respond to Gender -based Violence and by establishing an independent National Student 
Ombudsman.     |  Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 2  |  Foreword  
Women shouldn't feel they have to stay in a violent relationship because there's nowhere to 
go. That’s why th is Budget includes funding for a new fiv e-year, $9.3 billion National 
Agreement on Social Housing and Homelessness with states and territories. This represents 
an increase of $423  million , with the  Commonwealth doubling  its dedicated funding 
allocation for homelessness services to $400  million  a year – funding that states and 
territories must match.  The Government is also targeting a $1 billion  increase to  the 
National Housing Infrastructure Facility towards crisis and transitional accommodation for 
women and children fleeing domestic violence, a nd youth.  
To help us  better prevent violence , the Government is establishing an expert panel to  
undertake a rapid review of prevention approaches and to provide advice on how we can 
improve outcomes and build on existing efforts .  
Ensuring women’s economic security is critical for reducing risk and giving women more 
choices. Women remain over -represented in lower income brackets, as lower paid workers, 
and as recipients of government payments. This Budget continues the Government’s 
commitment to relieving cost -of-living pressures, including for women. The Government’s 
tax cuts, informed by gender analysis, will provide cost -of-living relief to all women 
taxpayers and reduce disincentives to their workforce participation. 90 per cent of women 
taxpayers will receive a bigger tax cut than they would have under the previous 
government’s plan.  
The Government is also delivering additional energy bill relief to all households  and 
further increasing the maximum rates of Commonwealth Rent Ass istance , which will 
particularly help households in financial stress, many of which are single mother 
households.  
This Budget’s investments in women’s health aim to address the higher health costs faced 
by women, while ensuring greater choice, access and support for sexual and reproductive 
health, including menopause, endometriosis and pelvic pain.  
Reforms to Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) indexation will ensure that when 
women invest in their education, growth in their loans does not outpace growth  in wages. 
Women will be big beneficiaries of our new Commonwealth Prac Payment, which will 
support students in female -dominated courses of nursing, teaching, midwifery and social 
work. These professions are in demand, and prac payments will help more wome n 
graduate and join the workforce.  
The undervaluing of paid and unpaid care is a driver of women’s lower incomes and 
lifetime earnings. This Budget continues our historic reform of Paid Parental Leave by 
introducing a superannuation guarantee equivalent pa yment on Government -funded Paid 
Parental Leave for parents of babies born or adopted on or after 1 July 2025. This is a strong 
signal that care is valued and will help close the superannuation gap which currently sees 
women retire with around 25 per cent l ess super than men. This Budget also prioritises the 
care economy, making a provision to deliver on our commitment to provide funding 
towards wage increases for aged care workers and early childhood educators, with details 
to be finalised following Fair Wo rk Commission processes.  Women's Budget State ment   |

A future made in Australia relies on a strong, highly skilled workforce, but high rates of 
industry gender segregation mean we are not tapping into the full talent pool of our 
country. This Budget invests in making sure that all A ustralians have the opportunity to 
access the jobs and careers of the future – this includes the Building Women’s Careers 
program that will boost women’s participation in construction, clean energy and advanced 
manufacturing industries, and technology and digital sectors, ensuring women benefit 
from the opportunities of a future made in Australia.  
We are making structural investments to help make Australia a country where a person’s 
gender imposes no limit on how their life unfolds — the rights they enjoy, the choices they 
make, or how safe they feel.  
The Women’s Budget Statement is now a reporting mechanism for Working for Women . 
From this Budget onward, the Women’s Budget Statement will report on our investments 
to implement Working for Women .  
Since our first Budget in 2022, we have reintroduced gender responsive budgeting — 
making gender analysis a core budget practice. The analysis includes consideration of 
women’s safety, including addressing risk, ensuring appropriate and trauma -informed 
support and i nteractions with victim -survivors and considering interactions with 
perpetrators. The five priorities of Working for Women , along with its foundational focus on 
positive gender attitudes and ending stereotypes, are a touchstone for gender responsive 
budget ing. 
We know this is not the work of one budget or one term of government. We  will continue 
to invest in women’s safety and economic equality, in valuing paid and unpaid care, in 
women’s health , and in leadership , representation and decision -making, and on  shifting the 
gendered attitudes and stereotypes that limit and harm us. And we remain committed to 
working with women around Australia to drive change and make a difference where it 
matters to them.

 Overview   |  Page 5 Overview  
The Government is committed to an Australia where people are safe, treated with respect, 
have choices and access to resources , and equal outcomes no matter their gender. The 
pathway to achieving this vision is set out in Working for Women: A Strategy for Gender 
Equality (Working for Women ). Working for Women  sets out five priority areas for Government 
action to drive change:  gend er-based  violence; unpaid and paid  care; economic equality  
and security ; health ; and leadership , representation and decision -making. Working for 
Women  also names positive gender attitudes and an end to stereotypes as the foundation s 
needed to achieve gende r equality.  
The Women ’s Budget Statement forms part of the reporting framework for Working for 
Women , providing a line of sight to the Government ’s activities across the five priority 
areas. This Women’s Budget Statement outlines key actions and investments made by the 
Government in the 2024 –25 Budget and the 2023 –24 Mid -Year Economic and Fiscal 
Outlook  (MYEFO), and how they are driving progress towards the long -term ambitions 
necessary to achieve gender equality . Progress across all five prioriti es set out in Working for 
Women  is required to drive meaningful change. This Women’s Budget Statement is 
structured against the five priorities, highlighting efforts to shift stereotypes and attitudes 
throughout. In many instances, investments under one pr iority will help drive progress in 
another.  For example, reforms to the Paid Parental Leave scheme encourage shared caring 
responsibilities , whil e also  reducing the retirement savings gap to deliver more equitable 
economic outcomes  for women .  
The Governme nt is putting gender equality at the heart of policy and decision -making 
through the rollout of gender responsive budgeting. All areas of government are 
responsible for ensuring government policy and decision -making considers gender 
impacts, such as in rel ation to women’s safety and economic security. From the 2023 –24 
MYEFO, all Cabinet Submissions and New Policy Proposals required gender analysis. 
This  Women’s Budget Statement includes case studies of gender analysis in practice to 
show how it informed policy and investment to  support Working for Women .  
To ensure gender equality remains central to decision -making beyond the Budget, 
Government strategies will also consider gender impacts. Reporting on gender equality 
will be included in Australi an Government Annual Reports to illustrate efforts and actions 
across Government to improve the lives of women and progress gender equality .  
Gender -based violence  
Violence against women and children is a national crisis . In 2022 –23, an average of one 
woma n was killed every 11 days by a current or former intimate partner.1 The number of 
women dying as a result of men’s violence so far this year has further highlighted the 
unacceptable prevalence of gender -based violence across Australia.   
However, violence  is not inevitable. High rates of gender -based violence can be addressed 
through shifting the social, cultural, political and economic factors that lead to violent 
behaviour. The National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children 2022 –2032    |  Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 6  |  Overview  
continues to guide the efforts of all Australian governments to end gender -based violence 
in one generation.  
The Government is continuing to drive change to end violence  by providing an additional 
$1.1 billion in this Budget and 2023 –24 MYEFO  bringing  the total  investment in women’s 
safety to $3.4 billion  since October  2022. The Government is also developing a standalone 
First  Nations National Plan for family safety to address the disproportionately high rates of 
violence against Aboriginal and Torres  Strai t Islander women and children. It will be 
guided by the newly established First  Nations National Plan Steering Committee to embed 
the voices and experiences of First  Nations peoples in the First  Nations National  Plan.  
This Budget invests $925.2  million  over five years from 2023 –24 to  permanently establish 
the Leaving Violence Program (LVP).  This investment will  help  people experiencing 
intimate partner violence to leave those relationships, providing those eligible with access 
to up to $5,000 in financial s upport along with referral services, risk assessments and safety 
planning. This funding is on top of other investments to strengthen the social safety net , 
such as through back -to-back boosts to Commonwealth Rent Assistance, and the 2023 –24 
Budget measure to expand eligibility for Parenting Payment  (Single).  
As a step towards strengthening prevention efforts, the Government is commissioning an 
expert -led rapid review of best practice approaches to prevention. The Government is also 
delivering a ran ge of new measures to tackle factors that exacerbate violence against 
women, such as violent online pornography and misogynistic content targeting children 
and young people.  
Unpaid and paid care  
Women continue to spend more time caring for children, agein g parents or other family 
members, and people with disability, than men. One -third of the gender pay gap is 
attribut able to women taking time out of the workforce to care for family and other 
interruptions in full -time employment , which results in women ha ving less pay and fewer 
opportunities for promotions and management positions.2 In addition, gendered norms 
and stereotypes that women are ‘natural carers’ further widens the gender pay gap by 
encouraging women to gravitate towards the paid care sector wh en seeking education and 
employment. Paid care roles are traditionally undervalued, underpaid and insecure . 
The Government recognises that gender equality cannot be achieved without better valuing 
both paid and unpaid care. In this Budget, the Government i s providing greater flexibility 
to recipients of the Carer Payment, who are overwhelmingly women, to undertake paid 
work, study or volunteering activities. To better value the paid care sector and address 
workforce shortages in highly feminised fields, the  Government is committing to provide 
funding towards wage increases for workers in the early childhood education and care and 
aged care sectors, and investing to support students . And through reforms to the Paid 
Parental Leave scheme and further parenting support, the Government is encouraging 
fathers and partners to play a more active role in the unpaid care of children.  Women's Budget State ment   |

Economic equality and security  
Significant progress has been made in recent decades towards economic equality and 
security for women. La bour force participation rates have increased, particularly for 
younger generations of women, and more women are attaining higher education 
qualifications. Women’s workforce participation has increased from around one-third in 
the 1960s to nearly two -third s today, and in 2023 the proportion of women aged 15  to 
74 years  old holding a non -school qualification was 64  per cent for women (compared with 
56 per cent in 2014).3 Despite this, women are still paid less than men on average, are more 
likely to experience economic disadvantage, and have lower superannuation balances at 
retirement.  
The Government recognises that households are under pressure from high but moderating  
inflation and higher interest rates . The Government’s tax cuts provide cost -of-living relief  
for low - to middle -income families and reduce disincentives  to take on more hours of work, 
particularly for women. The Government is also delivering add itional energy bill relief to 
all households  and further increasing the maximum rates of Commonwealth Rent 
Assistance,  which will particularly help households in financial stress, many of which are 
single mother households.  
The Government is committed to reducing workforce gender segregation as part of creating 
a future made in Australia. This Budget includes investments to support more women to 
pursue careers in key high -demand industries to deliver on the twin objectives of meeting 
our workforce needs an d ensuring women share in the jobs of the future.  
The Government recognises that progress has not been equal for all Australian women.  
This Budget includes investments to provide First  Nations women in remote communities 
more opportunities for real jobs, proper wages and decent conditions  as well as action to 
prevent and address migrant worker exploitation . The Government is also investing in 
women’s economic security by paying superannuation on Government -funded Paid 
Parental Leave.  
Health  
Sex and gender are key determinants of health and wellbeing. Women face different 
barriers to accessing healthcare to men. Gender bias in the health system can impact the 
healthcare that women receive, which can prevent or delay the diagnosis or appropriate 
treatm ent of their health conditions. To achieve gender equality, health systems need to 
respond to the needs of women and girls.  
The Government is increasing access to essential health services for women, including 
maternal, sexual and reproductive healthcare . In this Budget, the Government is continuing 
to strengthen Medicare to make it easier and more affordable to access healthcare. 
This  includes longer  Medicare Benefits Schedule consultations with gynaecologists, 
expanding the range of free mental health se rvices and affordable treatment for breast 
cancer. This Budget  also invests to improve research and data on women’s health to help   |  Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 8  |  Overview  
address gender bias within the health system, and support general practitioner training in 
long -acting reversible contracepti ves and menopause . 
Leadership, representation and decision -making  
While significant achievements have been made to improve women’s participation in 
leadership, representation and decision -making across Australia’s public and private 
sectors, there is still  a long way to go. More women, including First  Nations women, 
women with disability and women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, 
need to be represented in decision -making roles to achieve gender equality.  
The Government is leading by example through implementing new targets for women’s 
representation on Australian Government boards to include portfolio -level targets of 
50 per cent representation of women on boards and 50  per cent representation of women in 
Chair and Deputy Chair positions. Government policy levers are also being utilised to 
drive gender equality. The Government has announced it will introduce a new legislative 
requirement for businesses with 500 or more employe es to commit to gender equality 
targets for their workplaces through the Workplace Gender Equality Agency reporting .Gender -based violence   |  Page 9 Gender -based violence  
All Australians have the right to be free from violence and live without fear. Gender 
equality cannot be achieved wit hout ending gender -based violence. In early 2024, 
reporting on the number of women who have died as a result of men’s violence has 
contributed to a national conversation about the unacceptable prevalence of 
gender -based violence across Australia and the ne ed for urgent action. This situation 
is not new and reflects a global challenge that can only be addressed through 
concerted efforts – both short - and longer -term. Through the National Plan to End 
Violence against Women and Children 2022 –2032 (National Plan), all Governments, 
including the Australian Government, have set a goal  to end gender -based violence 
in a generation.  
Commitments in this Budget bring the Government’s total investment to support 
women’s safety and help deliver the National  Plan to $3.4  billion . Working for 
Women: A Strategy for Gender Equality  complements the National Plan by outlining 
the Australian Government’s commitment that all people live free from violence and 
are safe at home, at school, at work, in the community  and online.  
This chapter provides an overview of the Government’s commitment and ongoing 
action to ending gender -based violence. It highlights new actions in this Budget, 
including to accelerate efforts to prevent violence and intervene early, and to 
provide  targeted support for victim -survivors in areas such as financial support, 
legal assistance and support for refugee and migrant women. These measures 
represent the next step in the Government’s ongoing efforts to address violence 
against women . 
The Governm ent’s efforts complement work across states and territories, who are 
generally responsible for frontline service provision and law and justice responses. 
On 1  May  2024, the Prime Minister convened an urgent National Cabinet meeting 
that focussed exclusivel y on stopping violence against women. All First Ministers 
want violence against women and children to stop.  
Efforts to end violence will be strengthened through gathering data and monitoring 
progress against measurable targets that have been agreed by Aust ralian and state 
and territory governments for the first time. While the scale of the issue is well 
understood, making progress to end violence against women will rely on data that 
highlights impacts across different cohorts and the core features of effect ive 
approaches to prevention and response.

Gender -based violence – key statistics  
On average, one woman was killed 
every 11 days by a current or former 
intimate partner in 2022 –23 In 2022 –23, the rate of intimate 
partner homicide for First  Nations 
women was six  times the rate for 
other  women  
Just over one in four women  
(27% or 2.7  million) have  
experienced violence or abuse  
by a cohabiting partner  Almost one in four women  
(23% or 2.3  million) have  
experienced emotional abuse  
by a cohabiting partner  
Female university students (62.9%) 
were more likely to have experienced 
sexual harassment in their lifetime 
than male students (26%)  In 2022 –23, 75% of specialist 
homelessness service clients who 
had ex perienced family and domestic 
violence were female  
The Australian Institute of Criminology has been reporting intimate partner homicide data 
in respect to women since 1989 –90, when 60 women were murdered by an intimate partner. 
Since then, there has been  an overall decline, however, it is not unusual to see fluctuations 
between years. The National Homicide Monitoring Program data shows during the 
COVID -19 lockdown years of 2020 –2022, there was a significant decline in female intimate 
partner homicides. In  2019 –20, 37 women were killed by an intimate partner compared to 
27 in 2020 –21 and 26 in 2021 –22.4 An increase was seen in 2022 –23, with 34 women killed by 
a current or former intimate partner.  
There is no acceptable level of deaths from gender -based vio lence.  
The Government has announced a new statistical dashboard to improve the reporting and 
measurement of intimate partner homicide. To be released in mid -2024, the intimate 
partner homicide dashboard developed by the Australian Institute of Criminology will 
provide accurate, verified and closer to real -time data, with cumulative, quarterly data on 
incidents of intimate partner homicide, by current or former partners. This data is different 
to other sources of data led by community organisations and based  on media reports, such 
as Counting Dead Women Australia and the Red Heart Campaign, which counts women 
killed overwhelmingly by men as a result of all forms of violence. The dashboard will help 
to develop a better understanding of contributing factors and  inform responses by law 
enforcement, the family, domestic and sexual violence sector and policy makers. It will also Women's Budget State ment   |   
 
Gender -based violence   |  Page 11 
support governments to track progress against the National Plan to End Violence against 
Women and Children 2022 –2032  (National Plan) targe t to reduce female intimate partner 
homicides by 25  per cent each year.  
It is also critical that victim -survivors are at the heart of solutions and policies. To support 
this, the Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence Commission has established a National 
Lived Experience Advisory Council  to embed the voices of people with lived experience of 
domestic, family and sexual violence in policy at the national level.  
National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children 
2022 –2032  
The National Plan sets out the vision to end gender -based violence in Australia in one 
generation. The Government has invested in a range of  measures that support the 
outcomes of the National Plan and is working jointly with states and territories on its 
implementation.  
The First A ction Plan 2023 –2027 (First Action Plan) is driving the first five -year effort of 
achieving the National Plan’s vision by committing to actions to improve the safety of 
women and children, including across health, housing, education, justice and employment  
settings. Accompanying the First Action Plan, an Activities Addendum will be updated 
annually to include new activities and report on implementation of existing activities, with 
the first update expected before the end of 2024.  
An Outcomes Framework will measure progress towards the long -term outcomes of the 
National Plan, with the performance measurement plan , released in May  2024 and on an 
annual basis hereafter, being the primary mechanism to monitor change and guide 
investment over the life of the ten-year National Plan.   
The investments in the Budget and in MYEFO build on the 85 Commonwealth initiatives to 
support the National Plan that are underway . This wide range of initiatives is funded 
through the $2.3  billion invested across the Government’s first two Budgets to deliver the 
Government’s commitments across the domains of the National Plan  and support women’s 
safety  (see Box  1 below) .    |  Women's Budget Statement

The Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander Action Plan 2023 –2025 (Action Plan) supports the 
delivery of initiatives to address the immediate safety needs of Aboriginal and Torres  Strait 
Islander women, children and families. The Action Plan also establishes a strong 
foundation for longer -term structural change that will be carried forward through the 
First  Nations National Plan for Family Safety.

Box 2: Firs t Nations National Plan  
The First  Nations National Plan will provide a whole of society approach to address 
the disproportionately high rates of family violence and abuse against First  Nations 
women and children and provide further action to address Target  13 of Closing the 
Gap:  by 2031, the rate of all forms of family violence and abuse against Aboriginal 
and Torres  Strait Islander women and children is reduced by 50  per cent, as progress 
towards zero.  
In January  2024, the Government appointed 24 members t o form the First  Nations 
National Plan Steering Committee (Steering Committee) to work in genuine 
partnership with government to provide advice and guidance on the development 
of the First  Nations National Plan. Over its two -year term, the Steering Committ ee 
will oversee the development of the First  Nations National Plan, inform and guide 
consultation, and identify and engage widely with stakeholders nationally.  
The Government is partnering with SNAICC – National Voice for Our Children, to 
provide secretar iat support to the Steering Committee, conduct community 
consultation and develop the First  Nations National Plan under the Steering 
Committee’s guidance. Nation -wide consultations for the First  Nations National 
Plan will be undertaken to ensure it is info rmed by First  Nations voices.  
 
Preventing violence against women and children  
It is everyone’s role to seek to stop violence against women and children before it occurs, 
not just respond to it. Preventing violence must have a focus on the role that men and boys 
play across all parts of society, as people who will work to embed prevention approaches in 
all settings. This includes their roles as educators, employers and employees, frontline 
workers, journalists, legal professionals, sportspeople, paren ts and carers, and leaders. 
Addressing violence against women requires cultural and systemic responses across all 
levels of government and community.  Women's Budget State ment   |   
 
Gender -based violence   |  Page 15 
Budget highlights: Accelerating efforts to prevent violence  
The Government recognises the importance of fo cusing on prevention and is 
investing in swift and targeted expert advice to support evidence -based approaches. 
This will strengthen efforts to intervene earlier to  prevent men perpetrating  violence 
including where there is higher risk – for example due to  financial stress, mental 
health, or alcohol and drug issues.  
The Government is investing $1.3  million over two years from 2023 –24 to establish 
an independent expert panel to undertake a rapid review of the approach to violence 
prevention and advise Gover nment on additional efforts to end the cycle of violence. 
This will focus on evidence -based approaches to preventing violence, new methods 
and whole of system opportunities, with a focus on high -risk perpetrators and 
prevention of homicide. The independent  expert panel will be supported by the 
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and will report back to Government 
in the third -quarter of 2024.  
The expert panel and future work to end gender -based violence will be supported 
by $4.3  million in 2024 –25 for Australia’s National Research Organisation for 
Women’s Safety (ANROWS) to further build the evidence base on pathways into 
and out of perpetration.  
Additional funding of $3.9  million over four years from 2024 –25 (and 
$1.0 million  per year ongoing) is  also being invested in additional resourcing for the 
Office for Women, in the Department  of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, to support 
whole -of-government coordination efforts towards women’s safety. This work will 
complement the work of the Department of Social Services as the policy steward of 
the National Plan. This funding supports the Government’s commitment to 
strengthen gender equality and is additional to the Office for Women’s existing 
staffing of 64 Average Staffing Level , which will  be maintained going forward 
through reprioritisations within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

Box 3: Working with states and territories to prevent violence and target 
high -risk perpetrators  
At the Meeting of National Cabinet on gender -based violence on 1  May  2024, First 
Ministers agreed that system responses need to be strengthened, with a focus on 
high -risk perpetrators  and serial offenders to prevent homicides. This involves work 
across all jurisdictions.  
First Ministers agreed : 
• To task Police Ministers Council and the Standing Council of Attorneys -General 
to develop options for improving police responses to high -risk and serial 
perpetrators, including considering use of focused deterrence and fixated threat 
strategies  
• To improv e information sharing about perpetrators across systems and 
jurisdictions, with work to be led by the Commonwealth Minister for Women  
who is also  chair of the Data and Digital Ministers Meeting  
• States and territories will explore opportunities to strengthe n national 
consistency and drive best practice approaches across jurisdictions, including 
relating to risk assessment and responses to sexual assault.  
National Cabinet will also be briefed on this work and the rapid review of 
prevention approaches later th is year . 
 
Supporting women and children experiencing violence  
The Government is committed to strengthening services and systems to help 
victim -survivors to leave violence and support their long -term recovery. Targeted 
investments are being made to addres s violence in higher education settings, and provide a 
range of financial, legal, health and housing supports, and assistance for migrant women.  
Support to leave family and domestic violence  
Financial insecurity is a major contributing factor in a woman’s decision to leave, stay in or 
return to a violent relationship. Women who leave violent relationships suffer a drop in 
income of as much as 45  per cent.5 According to the 2021 –22 Personal Safety Survey, of the 
1.4 million women who experienced vio lence by a previous partner whilst living together, 
43 per cent (583,800) temporarily separated. Of these 583,800 women, 21 .5 per cent returned 
to the partner due to lack of financial resources.6 
The Escaping Violence Payment (EVP) trial and the Temporary Visa Holders Experiencing 
Violence Pilot (TVP) continue to provide financial support to victim -survivors to leave 
violent relationships. More than 45,000 Australians have accessed the EVP since its 
commencement in 2021. The TVP has also provided over $14 .0 million in financial Women's Budget State ment   |   
 
Gender -based violence   |  Page 17 
assistance to over 4,300 victim -survivors on temporary visas who have experienced family 
and domestic violence.   
A 2023 independent evaluation of the EVP trial found that the majority of clients 
surveyed  (92 per cent) agreed  that the payment helped relieve financial stress and 
51 per cent agreed that without the payment they could not have left a violent relationship.7 
Demand for financial support has continued to grow, with a 60  per cent increase in 
applications received be tween July and December  2023.  
Temporary visa holders experiencing family and domestic violence face additional barriers 
when leaving, or seeking to leave, a violent partner relationship. The TVP has highlighted 
the importance of access to legal assistance for victim -survivors on temporary visas.    |  Women's Budget Statement

Budget highlights: Leaving Violence Program  
The Government is delivering a landmark investment of $925.2  million over five 
years from 2023 –24 to permanently establish the Leaving Violence Program (LVP). 
The LVP wil l support victim -survivors of intimate partner violence, including 
migrants regardless of their visa status, to make choices about leaving violent 
relationships through the provision of individualised financial support packages.  
The program will provide el igible victim -survivors, who are predominantly women, 
with up to $5,000 in financial support, including up to $1,500 in cash and up to 
$3,500 in goods and services. Support services will also be provided including safety 
planning, risk assessment, and refe rrals to other services for up to 12 weeks.  
The new LVP builds on the successes and learnings of the Escaping Violence 
Payment (EVP) trial and the Temporary Visa Holders Experiencing Violence Pilot 
(TVP), to establish a new program that ensures eligible victim -survivors leaving 
violence are able to access support.  
Unlike the EVP trial, the $5,000 financial support component of LVP will be indexed 
annually to help ensure the payment keeps up with the cost of living. Combining the 
EVP trial and the TVP into a single program will ensure a ‘no wrong door’ approach 
for victim -survivors.  
Establishing the LVP as a permanent program provides certainty for 
victim -survivors, service providers and the broader Family, Domestic and Sexual 
Violence (FDSV) sector.  
The LVP will commence in mid -2025, following the procurement of an appropriate 
service provider with FDSV experience, and the transition of the EVP trial and the 
TVP into the program.  
The EVP trial and the TVP will be extended until 30  June  2025, and support services 
will continue to be provided for a further 12 weeks beyond the pilot end date for 
active cases.  
Tempora ry visa holders will continue to be able t o access legal support services for 
migration and family law issues with funding being extended for a further 
five years .  Women's Budget State ment   |

Box 4: Government funding to support women who may be experiencing 
violence  
In addition to the National Plan, the Government has als o invested in a range of 
services and initiatives that support women’s financial security, including those at 
risk of or impacted by gender -based violence.  
This funding includes:   
• $253.4 million  over f ive years from 2023 –24 for 1800RESPECT , the national 
counselling, information and referral service for people affected by domestic, 
family and sexual violence. 1800RESPECT provides frontline support, and 
includes options for phone, text, video call and online chat counselling support . 
• $35.4 bi llion over five years from 2023 –24 to fund Parenting Payment (Single). In 
the 2023 –24 Budget, the Government expanded eligibility for Parenting Payment 
(Single) to single principal carers with a youngest child under 14  year s of age, up 
from eight  year s of age. This provides support to single parents, overwhelmingly 
women, including those who have experienced family and domestic violence.  
•  $31.8 billion over five  year s from  2023 -24 on Commonwealth Rent Assistance 
which includes  a 10 per cent increase in this Budget, building on last year’s 
Budget which delivered a 15  per cent increase, the largest increase in over 
30 year s. Just over half (51  per cent) of the people who benefit from the further 
increase to maximum rates are single women (compa red to 27  per cent who are 
single men).  
• The $10.0  billion Housing Australia Future Fund (HAFF) will help support 
20,000  new social homes, including  for women and children experiencing 
domestic and family violence, and older women on low incomes who are at risk 
of homelessness.  
• Targe ting the $1 .0 billion  increase  to the National Housing Infrastructure Facility 
to better support housing for women and children experiencing domestic 
violence and youth.  
 
Preventing extreme online misogyny and supporting online  safety  
A critical challenge for ending violence against women is the changing nature of 
technology, and the risks posed to women by online environments. Social media 
algorithms can push misogynistic content to young people, normalising sexist or even 
violent attitudes and undermining gender equality. There is also growing concern around 
the role of violent online pornography in normalising gender -based violence within the 
Australian community.  
Preventing and addressing gender -based violence means adapting to new environments 
where sexism and misogyny can be perpetuated, and taking action to prevent these harms 
from reaching the community, especially young people.    |  Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 20  |  Gender -based violence  
The Government’s Stop it at the Start campaign has been a key initiative to drive atti tudinal 
change and prevent violence. A new phase of the Stop it at the Start campaign will launch 
in mid -June and run until May  2025. This new phase will specifically include a 
counter -influencing campaign in online spaces where violent and misogynistic co ntent 
thrives, to directly challenge the material in the spaces it is being viewed.  
The campaign is intended to counter the corrosive influence of online content targeted at 
young adults that condones violence against women. It will raise awareness about a  
proliferation of misogynistic influencers and content, and encourage conversations within 
families about the damaging impact of the material.  
Budget highlights: Age assurance pilot  
The Government will provide $6.5  million in 2024 –25 to develop a pilot of age 
assurance technologies to protect children from harmful online content, like 
pornography and other age -restricted online services . 
This pilot is part of a suite of interventions aimed at curbing easy access to material 
known to ca use harm  to children and young people, and tackling extreme misogyny 
online. The pilot will help identify available age assurance products to protect 
children from  online harm, and test their efficacy, including in relation to privacy 
and security.  
The out comes will inform the existing work of Australia’s eSafety Commissioner 
under the Online  Safety  Act – including through the development of industry codes 
or standards – to reduce children’s exposure to age -inappropriate material.  
  Women's Budget State ment   |   
 
Gender -based violence   |  Page 21 
Box 5: Preventing onlin e harm  
The Government is also introducing a range of reforms that seek to address the 
changing ways gender -based violence is perpetuated online.  
The Government will introduce legislation to ban the creation and non -consensual 
distribution of sexually expl icit deepfake material. Digitally created and altered 
sexually explicit material is a damaging form of abuse against women and girls that 
can inflict deep harm on victims. The reforms will make clear that creating and 
sharing sexually explicit material wit hout consent, using technology like artificial 
intelligence, will be subject to serious criminal penalties.  
In response to concerns about the role of violent online pornography in perpetuating 
attitudes and behaviours that lead to gender -based violence, th e Government is 
undertaking long overdue classification reforms with states and territories which 
will examine options to reduce exposure to violent pornography, informed by 
engagement with experts and best available evidence about harms.  
The Government will also bring forward legislation in 2024 to outlaw the malicious 
release of private  information online (known as doxxing) and overhaul the 
Privacy  Act 1988  to give all Australians, and particularly women who are 
experiencing domestic and fami ly violence, greater control and transparency over 
their personal information.  
 
Legal and dispute resolution support for women and children  
The National Plan  highlights the importance of enhancing access to equitable justice 
outcomes for all victim -survivors, identifying and removing barriers to engaging with the 
justice system, strengthening accountability and consequences for perpetrators, and 
ensuring the policing and justice workforce have the tools and training to respond 
effectively to the use of violence.  
First  Nations families can face barriers in accessing culturally appropriate support from 
mainstream support services for separated and separating families. T he First  Nations 
Family Dispute Resolution pilot supports selected Aboriginal Commun ity Controlled 
Organisations to provide culturally appropriate alternative family dispute resolution to 
clients. Through this pilot, selected Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisations can 
recruit and train staff to provide family dispute resolution, an d to modify service delivery 
approaches to offer more culturally appropriate services.  
The National Legal Assistance Partnership 2020 –25 provides funding to legal services, 
including to women experiencing gender -based violence. With the current National L egal 
Assistance Partnership  to expire in mid -2025, an independent review has been undertaken 
to evaluate the extent to which the objective, outcomes and outputs of the National Legal 
Assistance Partnership have been achieved  and consider how future arrange ments could   |  Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 22  |  Gender -based violence  
better provide access to justice . The findings of the review will be considered during the 
development of future legal assistance arrangements beyond June  2025.  
The community legal sector is a female -dominated workforce.8 Salaries for the community 
legal sector are significantly less than those attainable in private practice or for equivalent 
positions within government. Investing in the community legal sector is not just good for 
the many women who seek support through le gal services, it also supports closing the 
gender pay gap.  
Budget highlights: Funding dispute resolution and legal assistance  
• The Government will extend the First  Nations Family Dispute Resolution pilot by 
two years from 2024 –25, at a cost of approximately  $11.7 million , to allow a 
further period to establish new culturally safe and appropriate family dispute 
resolution service models. This will enable currently  funded services to continue 
to pilot  these  services to separated and separating families in thei r communities .  
• The Government will provide additional funding of $ 44.1 million in 2024 –25 to 
support the National Legal Ass istance Partnership and Family Violence 
Prevention Legal Services , including one -year indexation supplementation to the 
funding for Legal Aid Commissions, Community Legal Centres, and Aboriginal 
and Torres  Strait Islander Legal Services, and additional funding to reduce pay 
disparity in the legal assistance sector.  Providers supported by this measure  
deliver critical advice and represe ntation to women experiencing, or at risk of 
experiencing, family and domestic violence.  
  Women's Budget State ment   |   
 
Gender -based violence   |  Page 23 
Box 6: Changes to the Family  Law Act 1975  
The Government has made changes to reform the Family  Law Act 1975  (Family Law 
Act) to make the family law system simpler and safer for parents and children. 
These changes, which commenced on 6  May  2024, repealed complex and confusing 
provisions around parenting orders, and replaced them with a simpler 
decision -making framework focused on what is in the child’s best i nterests. The 
Government also introduced new powers for courts to address systems abuse and 
improved the use of Independent Children’s Lawyers.  
The amendments to the Family  Law  Act also establish an enhanced information 
sharing framework between the family  law courts and state and territory child 
protection, policing and firearms agencies. The Framework will provide access to 
crucial family violence, child abuse and neglect risk information to inform decisions 
made in the best interests of children.  
The Gov ernment  is also considering feedback received on an exposure draft Bill, 
released for consultation in September  2023, which proposed amendments to the 
family law property division framework under the Family Law Act. Those proposed 
amendments sought to addr ess the financial impacts of family violence.  
 
Law enforcement systems information sharing to support the safety of 
women and children  
The National Plan highlights the role of strong data -sharing mechanisms in holding 
perpetrators accountable and keeping  women and children safe. Law enforcement systems 
that share data on perpetrators of gender -based violence across jurisdictions contribute to 
the vision of the National Plan to end gender -based violence in one generation.  
Budget highlights: Law enforcement  systems information sharing  
The Government has committed $109.9  million over two years to the Australian 
Criminal Intelligence Commission to support enhanced collaboration and 
information sharing through the continued integration of state and territory la w 
enforcement agencies into the National Criminal Intelligence System. The National 
Criminal Intelligence System provides law enforcement agencies with police 
intelligence and oth er criminal justice information in near real -time, such as 
domestic violence related protection orders . 
In addition to providing legal assistance, the Government is also working to strengthen 
responses to violence in the justice system. In September  2023, the Government in 
partnership with the states and territories released the National Principles to Address 
Coercive Control in Family and Domestic Violence  (National Principles) . The National   |  Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 24  |  Gender -based violence  
Principles will improve efforts to understand and identify coercive control to effectively 
respond to family and do mestic violence.  
Box 7: National Principles to Address Coercive Control in Family and 
Domestic Violence  
On 22  September  2023, the Australian, state and territory governments released the 
National Principles which outline a shared understanding of coercive  control and its 
impacts.  
The National Principles will help raise awareness of coercive control, inform more 
effective responses to  family and domestic violence, and promote more consistent 
support and safety outcomes for victim -survivors. The Government has released a 
range of supporting resources to support implementation of the National Principles, 
including videos, fact sheets, guides for healthcare professionals and tailored 
resources for First  Nations communities.  
 
Improving women’s housing security  
Family and domestic violence is the main reason women and children leave their homes in 
Australia. Many women and children leaving their homes may experience housing 
insecurity, and in some cases, homelessness. Of the 273,600 clients who accessed 
homeless ness services in 2022 –23, 38  per cent (or 104,000) were people experiencing family 
and domestic violence.9 Without adequate and appropriate housing, the essential rights of 
women and children to safety, security and privacy are compromised.  
The Governmen t is committed to investing in crisis accommodation as an immediate 
support to assist women and children to leave situations of family and domestic violence. 
Pathways to longer -term secure housing are also important for victim -survivors to 
re-establish the ir lives after leaving a violent relationship.  
The Budget includes funding for a new five -year, $9.3  billion  National Agreement on Social 
Housing and Homelessness with states and territories. This represents an increase of 
$423  million . Under the agreemen t, the Commonwealth will double its dedicated funding 
allocation for homelessness services to $400  million  a year – funding that states and 
territories must match.  
The Government will also target the $1  billion  increase to the National Housing 
Infrastructure Facility to better support housing for women and children experiencing 
domestic violence and for youth. The funding is being rebalanced to provide more up -front 
grants to support states and territories and c ommunity housing providers to deliver more 
housing for these cohorts.  Women's Budget State ment   |   
 
Gender -based violence   |  Page 25 
Crisis accommodation  
Access to safe accommodation is fundamental to the immediate safety of women and 
children experiencing family and domestic violence . Crisis and transitional housin g can 
provide immediate support to women and children experiencing family and domestic 
violence in the short -term.  
The intersection of homelessness and family and domestic violence can also have a 
significant impact on the mental health and wellbeing of in dividuals and families. 
Experiencing violence and homelessness can lead to trauma, significant stress and other 
mental health issues, further compounding the difficulties faced when leaving violent 
relationships.  
The Housing Australia Future Fund will pro vide  $100  million  in disbursements over five 
years for crisis and transitional housing options for women and children experiencing 
family and domestic violence , and older women at risk of homelessness . In addition, in the 
2022 –23 October Budget, the Govern ment committed an additional $100  million  over five 
years to continue the Safe Places Emergency Accommodation program via the Safe Places 
Inclusion Round . 
Budget highlights: Healthcare in crisis accommodation and services  
The Government will provide $6.0  million over two  years  from 2024 –25 for the 
provision of trauma -informed local outreach healthcare in crisis and temporary 
accommodation and services, to support women and children experiencing family, 
domestic and sexual violence. This support will be prov ided through Primary 
Health Networks on the Central Coast  and targeted to population groups at 
disproportionately h igher risk of violence.  Funding includes an independent 
evaluation on the impact of this support service for women and children who have 
expe rienced family, domestic and sexual violence.  
 
Safe housing in remote communities  
Housing issues, including homelessness, inadequate housing and overcrowding, 
disproportionately affect First  Nations people. The Wiyi Yani U Thangani  (Women’s Voices) 
Report found overcrowding heightens the risk of harms such as violence and abuse, 
thereby exacerbating trauma, stress and conflict.10 Addressing overcrowding in remote 
First  Nations communities, and improving access to culturally appropri ate living 
conditions, contributes to positive outcomes for First  Nations women and girls.    |  Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 26  |  Gender -based violence  
Budget highlights: Northern Territory Homelands and Housing  
With a landmark $4 .0 billion  investment over ten years the Australian and Northern 
Territory (NT) Governments are working towards a commitment to halve 
overcrowding in the NT by 2034. This Budget provides $ 698.4 million over 
four years from 2024 –25 (and $2 .0 billion  over ten years  from 2024 –25) to build  up to 
270 homes each year, $120 .0 million over three years from 2024 –25 to continue 
urgent repairs and maintenance of existing housing and essential infrastructure on 
homeland s, and a further $20 .0 million  in 2023 –24 to deliver an addition al 49 houses 
under the existing Remote Housing Northern Territory Federation  Funding 
Agreement . 
 
Targeted support to improve women’s safety  
Improving women’s safety at university  
The 2021 National Student Safety Survey found that ne arly one in two university 
students  (48 per cent) have experienced sexual harassment at least once in their lifetime and 
one in three university students (30.6  per cent) had experienced sexual assault at least once. 
Sexual harassment and sexual assault was  disproportionately experienced by women, 
transgender students, LGBTIQA+ students, students who were gender -diverse, younger 
students, students with a disability and students who live in student accommodation.  
Fewer than one in two (47.5  per cent) students  who had experienced sexual assault in a 
university context, and formally reported it, said their university had explained the 
reporting or complaints process to them, while fewer than one in three (29.7  per cent) were 
satisfied with the process.11 
In Febr uary  2024, the Government, in conjunction with the states and territories, released 
the Action Plan Addressing Gender -based Violence in Higher Education.  Women's Budget State ment   |   
 
Gender -based violence   |  Page 27 
Budget highlights: Addressing violence in higher education  
• Under the Action Plan Addressing Gender -based Violence in Higher Education, 
the Government has committed to $18.7  million over four years from 2024 –25 to 
develop and introduce a National Higher Education Code to Prevent and 
Respond to Gender -based Violence. The National Code will set requirements f or 
higher education providers to embed a whole -of-organisation approach and 
strengthen accountability for systemic issues relating to gender -based violence.  
• Complementing this work, the Government has committed $19.4  million over 
two years from 2024 –25 to  establish an independent National Student 
Ombudsman. The Ombudsman will investigate student complaints and resolve 
disputes with higher education providers. Students will be able to escalate 
complaints about the administrative actions of their higher educ ation provider, 
including complaints relating to sexual harassment, assault and violence.   
 
Support for migrant and refugee women experiencing violence  
Migrant and refugee women can face specific forms of discrimination and disadvantage 
which intersect with their experiences of family and domestic violence. Women on 
temporary visas may fear that leaving a violent relationship will impact their visa status 
and can face barriers accessing support services. The Department of Home Affairs’ 
speciali sed visa support service assists temporary visa holder experiencing family and 
domestic violence. It has  managed  over 1,700 client referrals since being piloted in 
July 2021.  
Budget highlights: Support for temporary visa holders experiencing 
violence  
The G overnment will provide $6.1  million over four years from 2024 –25 (and 
$1.6 million  per year ongoing) to continue specialised support for visa holders 
experiencing domestic and family violence through the Domestic and Family 
Violence visa support service.  
    |  Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 28  |  Gender -based violence  
MYEFO highlights: Addressing forced marriage and violent relationships  
The Government has committed $18.6  million over five years from 
2023 –24 (and  $3.8 million  per year ongoing) to support temporary visa holders 
leaving violent relationships and peop le who are at risk of, or who have 
experienced, forced marriage. Funding includes:  
• $12.1  million over five years from 2023 –24 (and $3.8  million  per year ongoing) to 
establish the Forced Marriage Specialist Support Program. The program will 
provide caseworker support, counselling, temporary accommodation and 
financial support for those at risk of, or who have experienced, forced marriage  
• $4.4 million over two years from 2023 –24 to increase financial support available 
under the Temporary Visa Holders Experiencing Violence Pilot to $5,000 
(previously $3,000) to align with the Escaping Violence Payment  
• $2.2 million over four years from 2024 –25 to extend S peak Now, Australia’s 
national  forced marriage community education service, to prevent forced 
marriage and other forms of modern slavery through education, 
awareness -raising and collaboration with frontline workers and communities.  
 Unpaid and paid care   |  Page 29 Unpaid and paid care  
While women’s labour force participation has increased, women  still undertake the 
majority of unpaid care in Australia. Unpaid care refers to time spent looking after 
children, ageing parents, other fami ly members and people with disability, chronic 
health conditions and mental illness.  
Spending more time on unpaid care than their male counterparts impacts women’s 
lifelong economic security by limiting their labour force participation, career 
progression , and leadership opportunities. Additionally, gendered stereotypes and 
attitudes about women being ‘natural carers’ have meant paid care work is 
dominated by  women and migrant workers, with these roles historically 
undervalued , often low paid and insecure.  
The Government is committed to addressing this undervaluation and better 
recognising the substantial contribution of unpaid and paid care to Australia’s 
society and economy. In Working for Women: A Strategy for Gender Equality (Working 
for Women ), the Gov ernment committed to driving action to narrow the unpaid work 
and care gap between women and men, ensure parents and carers have access to 
affordable and high -quality early childhood and care services, and reduce the 
gender gap in use of, and access to, pa id parental leave.  
This Budget includes a range of investments and reforms to support parents and 
children and drive equality in care. The Government is investing in parenting 
supports for fathers to empower and build their parenting confidence and skills.  
Additionally, recent changes to the Government’s Paid Parental Leave (PPL) scheme 
will improve accessibility and flexibility of parental leave.  
The Government is also committing to provide funding towards wage increases for 
workers in the  early childhood  education and care and aged care sectors.  This 
Budget includes Commonwealth Prac Payments to support eligible students in 
nursing and midwifery, teaching and social work courses while they attend 
mandatory placements.

Unpaid care  
Australian women continue to spend more time than men participating in unpaid work, 
despite an increase in their workforce participation. This unpaid work limits women’s 
scope for greater participation in the paid labour force and in leadership roles, with 
cumulative impacts on their lifelong economic securit y. 
Data indicates that women of all ages continue to spend more time caring for children and 
taking on domestic household work than men (Chart  2.1). The gap in time spent on these 
activities between men and women grows rapidly into adulthood, reaching its peak during 
child -bearing years. This gap reduces somewhat for men and women over the age of 40 but 
remains persistent across all ages. Although women have slightly reduced their hours on 
domestic and caring responsibilities between 2002 and 2022, a large gender gap remains. 
The data suggests that hours of unpaid work and care performed by men aged under  40 
has not materially changed since 2002.  
Often unpaid care encompasses not only care for children, but also ageing parents and 
other relatives, including people with disability, chronic health conditions and mental 
illness. For some First  Nations women, caring responsibilities extend to protecting and Women's Budget State ment   |

caring for Country, which remains an important part of daily life and practice. A survey 
undertaken in part nership with the Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander Social Justice 
Commissioner’s Office shows that First  Nations women perform greater amounts of 
unpaid care than any other group surveyed, with unpaid care activities accounting for 
62 per cent of parti cipants’ time on a usual weekday.12  
Unpaid care work is not only a persistent barrier to workforce participation for many 
women, but it may also deter them from participating in higher intensity and better paid 
occupations and industries. It may influence the form of employment women take and the 
locations in which they are able to work, as well as increase the likelihood of working in 
part-time, casual and contract work, which tends to be less secure.

Page 32  |  Unpaid and paid care  
Budget highlights: Valuing care  
As outlined in the Employment White Paper, Working Future , the Government is 
committed to overcoming barriers to employment and improving participation.  
In the 2024 –25 Budget, the Government is providing $18.6  million over  five years 
from 2023 –24 and $3.1  million  per year ongoing to support Carer Payment recipients 
by changing the 25 hour  per week participation limit rules from 20  March  2025.  
The changes will amend the current participation hours limit to allow up to 
100 hours of work over a four -week settlement period. This will provide greater 
flexibility for Carer Payment recipients to structure their work commitments around 
the care needs of the person they care for, including for those with episodic or 
fluctuating cond itions, while remaining eligible for the payment. Travel time,  study 
and volunteering activities will also be excluded from the limit, and the use of single 
temporary cessation of care days will be allowed , rather than the current seven day 
minimum . Paymen ts will also be suspended for up to six months, rather than 
cancelled, when a carer exceeds their participation limit or allowable temporary 
cessation of care days. This supports more responsive access to payments if 
circumstances change.  
Around 31,000 Car er Payment recipients earn income, including over 25,000 women, 
and may benefit from greater flexibility to undertake paid work, study or 
volunteering.  
 
The gender gap in unpaid  care widens when families have children  
The gap between the time women  spend on unpaid work and care relative to men is largest 
between the ages of 3 1 and 35, a time when many families choose to have children. For this 
age group, women on average spend 18 more hours than men on unpaid labour per  week. 
More than half of this gap – over 11 hours per  week – is due to differences in the amount of 
time spent  on caring for children (Chart  2.2).  Women's Budget State ment   |

five years of parenthood, and this remains significant a decade into parenthood . In contrast, 
fathers’ work patterns remain, on average, unchanged, and parenthood has no significant 
long -term impact on earnings.  
Differences i n caring and household responsibilities hold true regardless of earning 
potential. In heterosexual partnerships where the woman is the primary earner, household 
labour is still disproportionately performed by women after the arrival of 
children  (Chart  2.3).    |  Women's Budget Statement

Note:  Values from two years after birth onwards are calculated as a two -period rolling average to smooth 
volatility. Primary earning status is defined as earning at least 25  per cent more than the 
individual’s partner and is calculated yearly. Individuals can change from primary to non -primary 
earner over time.  
 
Sharing care  
Sharing unpaid care benefits both men and women.  International evidence suggests that 
nations with a more equal distribution of unpaid care between women and men report 
higher employment rates for women and lower gender gaps in earnings.13 Domestically, 
data suggests that more active engagement in unpaid work, including caring for children, 
heightens relationship sa tisfaction for fathers and improves their ability to balance work 
and family commitments.14  
Access to well -functioning formal care and support systems can facilitate a more equal 
distribution of unpaid care. These systems provide women with greater autono my to 
increase workforce participation to their preferred levels. Greater workforce participation 
can increase women’s economic security and financial independence.  
Use of formal child care is increasing. This indicates parents are utilising formal child care 
to help them balance paid work and caring responsibilities.

Reforms to Paid Parental Leave will lead to more equitable outcomes  
Parental leave boosts women’s economic security by maintaining important linkages 
between women and their employers, ens uring employers can retain valued staff. 
Paid  parental leave increases the number of employees returning to work after parental 
leave, reduces recruitment costs and improves staff morale and productivity.  
The availability and uptake of employer funded parental leave is also increasing. 
In 2022 –23, the proportion of  employers offering universally available employer -funded 
parental leave rose by nine percentage points from the previous year to 21  per cent, in 
acknowledgement of the important role both parents play in child care. Men are also 
increasingly viewing access to adequate care supports as an integral feature of a successful 
career. The proportion of employer -funded primary carer parental leave taken by men 
increased by 0.6  percentage points in 2022 –23, with this shift being led by large employers 
in male -dominated industries.15 
The Government’s reforms to its Paid Parental Leave (PPL) scheme aim to support this shift 
in culture. The Government’s policy to pay superannuation o n Government -funded PPL 
will recognise the contribution parents make to society and reduce the negative impact of 
parental leave on retirement incomes . Further information on this commitment is included 
in Chapter 3:  Economic equality and security.     |  Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 36  |  Unpaid and paid care  
Gender  analysis in practice: Expansion to Paid Parental Leave  
The Government’s expansion to the PPL scheme was designed to improve support 
for families and to have a positive impact on gender equality by encouraging fathers 
and partners to play a more active rol e in the care of children.  
In expanding the PPL scheme to 26 weeks by 1  July 2026, the Government also 
sought to support more equal sharing of parenting and household responsibilities. 
Compared to women, fewer men take up Government -funded PPL. In 2022 –23, 
171,280 parents received Parental Leave Pay (with 99  per cent being the biological 
mother), while 88,645 parents claimed Dad and Partner Pay (with 98  per cent being 
the biological father).  
Gender analysis concluded that fathers and partners taking leave following the birth 
or adoption of a child has  positive impacts for women and their families. Under the 
new scheme, parents can take a portion of PPL at the same time which will increase 
to four weeks from 1  July 2025 (up from two weeks currently). This su pports parents 
to optimise their health, family and work obligations, with periods of concurrency 
allowing fathers and partners to undertake child caring duties and support the birth 
parent during recovery from childbirth. Research suggests this leads to m ore 
equitable division of care over a child’s lifetime.16 
To encourage more men to take up Government -funded PPL, the Government is 
increasing the reserved period of leave for each parent to four weeks by 1  July 2026. 
This means those weeks can only be acc essed by that parent but with flexibility for 
parents to take up to four weeks concurrently (from 1  July 2025). These changes, 
together with the increase in the total amount of PPL available, are designed to 
encourage more equal sharing of parenting and ho usehold responsibilities. 
This  contributes to gender equality and better supports parents to spend time with 
their children and participate in family life. Single parents will be able to access the 
full entitlement as it increases.  
 
In addition to expand ing the PPL scheme, the Government has also amended the 
Fair Work  Act 2009  to include greater flexibility for employees taking unpaid parental leave 
from 1  July 2023, allowing them to take up to 100 days of their 12 -month leave entitlement 
flexibly during the 24 -month period after the birth or placement of their child.  
Further, the Government is providing expanded parental leave entitlements to employees 
of the Australian Public Service (APS), supporting parenting as an equal partnership and 
encoura ging provision of best practice entitlements in the private sector. Parental leave for 
APS employees will increase to provide equal leave of 18 weeks for both caregivers by the 
end of February  2027. Primary caregivers will access 18 weeks from 2024, with t he ability to 
take it at half pay. Secondary caregivers receive eight weeks in 2024, progressively 
increasing to 18 weeks by the end of February  2027.  Women's Budget State ment   |

Societal barriers deter men from increasing participation in unpaid care  
Evidence suggests that when fat hers take parental leave in the first year of their child’s life, 
they are more likely to continue sharing in the care of their children. However, men who 
want to take on more care at home often face barriers to doing so. For example, many men 
who take par ental leave report discrimination when they return to work  and men who 
choose to access flexible work in the form of reduced hours as their children grow up 
experience higher levels of discrimination or harassment. This can discourage men from 
participatin g to the extent they want to in caring and household responsibilities. 
Male -dominated industries are less likely to offer universally available paid parental leave, 
presenting  another barrier to access.17 
Fathers experience emotional and social benefits fr om being supported to have an 
increased role in their children’s lives. KPMG found that greater involvement in their 
children’s lives increases ongoing participation of fathers in child care and other forms of 
unpaid work, heightens relationship satisfacti on and contributes to a better balance of work 
and family commitments.18 This has positive implications for fathers’ physical and mental 
health and, according to research, helps to rebalance the unpaid caring responsibilities in 
the home, giving women more flexibility to engage in the paid workforce to their preferred 
levels.19 
For children, research has shown that having an engaged and involved father increases the 
likelihood that the child will thrive across all areas of their life including their phy sical and 
mental health, self -esteem, educational outcomes and career prospects.20 This is all in 
addition to the economic benefit it provides for women.   
The Government recognises how critical the early years are for children’s development and 
continued s uccess over their lifetime. The Early Years Strategy, released on 7  May  2024, sets 
out the Government’s ten -year vision for children’s wellbeing and outcomes, and to drive 
policy and investment. The Strategy seeks to empower all parents and caregivers with  the 
skills, resources and capabilities they need in their roles. The Strategy was shaped through 
consultation with families, carers, early childhood experts, the early childhood sector and 
young children.    |  Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 38  |  Unpaid and paid care  
Budget highlight s: Supporting parents and carers  
The Government will extend existing community support for parents and caregivers 
to improve child outcomes in the early years, boost parents’ confidence and 
encourage more  shared care of children, in turn facilitating an increase in women’s 
economic partic ipation. This includes:  
• providing $ 4.8 million over two years from 2024 –25 for the Fathering Project  to 
continue to provide targeted parenting support for fathers, building their 
confidence to be primary or equal caregivers  
• funding of $ 4.6 million over two years from 2024 –25 for the Raising Children 
Network. The Raising Children’s Network provides web -based parenting 
information. Funding will further build parenting skills, knowledge and improve 
equitable access to information for all parent s and caregivers  
• providing $ 4.3 million over two years from 2024 –25 for the Supporting Expecting 
and Parenting Teens program administered by the Brave Foundation, to continue 
providing mentoring and case management support for young parents to 
strengthen t heir parenting skills, achieve their  goals and break the cycle of 
disadvantage faced by young parents and their children.  
These investments are aligned  with the Early  Years Strategy 2024 –2034.  
 
Valuing the paid care sector and other feminised industries  
Women are overrepresented in caring, teaching and nursing roles partly due to attitudes 
about them being ‘natural carers’. Workers in these industries have historically been lower 
paid compared with workers in other industries, including many where the wo rk has lower 
educational attainment  requirements.  
Care and support jobs are historically undervalued  
Caring roles were historically performed for free by family members, mainly women, 
disguising the level of skill and experience required to perform them and assuming a 
‘natural’ inclination to care. These lingering assumptions devalue  the additional 
qualif ications and standards of care that are now mandatory for some paid care roles. 
Although greater overall workforce participation by women has led to many caring roles 
transitioning to the formal economy, most of those roles are still held by women and many  
attract below -average pay.  
While pay for care and support jobs varies by role, median weekly earnings for many care 
and support roles remain below the economy -wide average.21 Low wages for care and 
support workers not only has the potential to undervalue their work but contributes to the 
gender pay gap and reinforces barriers to expanding the workforce. Ongoing government 
action continues to support strong wage growth for care  and support economy workers.  Women's Budget State ment   |   
 
Unpaid and paid care   |  Page 39 
Budget highlights: Valuing care workers  
On 7 December  2022, promoting gender equality became an objective of the 
Fair Work  Act 2009 , and on 6  March  2023 expert panels were created at the Fair Work 
Commission to focus on pay e quity and the care and community sector.  
In addition to these changes, the Government recognises the significant contribution 
of care workers to Australia’s society and economy. The Government is committed 
to better valuing care workers  and attracting and  retaining staff in these vital sectors.  
The Government is committed  to provide funding towards a wage increase for early 
childhood education and care workers to recognise the value of the workforce and 
support the Government’s ambition of universal acces s to affordable, quality early 
childhood education and care. Details will be finalised following the Fair Work 
Commission processes  currently underway . 
The Government strongly supports the decision of the Fair Work Commission to 
further increase the award wages for aged care workers. The Government has 
committed to funding this increase to wages once the final decision is delivered, 
building on the $11.3  billion  already allocated to support the interim increase of 
15 per cent for aged care workers.  A primar y consideration for the Fair Work 
Commission in this case was the historic undervaluation of these female -dominated 
occupations.  
The Government is also investing $ 87.2 million in workforce initiatives to support , 
attract and retain aged care staff.  This will benefit women, who comprise over 
85 per cent of the current aged  care workforce.  
 
Addressing workforce shortages in highly feminised industries  
Completion rates for nursing and teacher education courses, which are highly feminised 
industries, h ave declined. This has contributed to acute labour supply shortages across care 
and teaching professions.22 The Employment White Paper and Australian Universities 
Accord Fi nal Report found one of the barriers to completing these qualifications is that 
many  care and feminised industries require students to undertake lengthy placements , 
putting students at a financial disadvantage  by preventing students from engaging in 
paid  work.23 
    |  Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 40  |  Unpaid and paid care  
Budget highlights: Supporting nursing, teaching and social work students  
The Government will provide $1.6  billion  over 11 years to support nursing and 
midwifery, teaching and social work students in higher education and VET while 
they undertake mandatory placements required by their course. From 1  July 2025, 
the Common wealth  Prac Payment (CPP) will provide $319.50  per week to eligible 
students for the duration of their placement. The CPP is expected to support more 
than 73,000 students per  year .

Gender analysis in practice: Mandatory placements support for highly 
feminised industries  
The Government’s support payment for higher education and VET students 
undertaking unpaid mandatory placements in nursing and midwifery, teaching and 
social work cou rses will advance gender equality by reducing barriers to the 
completion of qualifications and assisting in meeting skills shortages in highly 
feminised fields.  
Women make up around 87  per cent of nursing, 75  per cent of initial teacher 
education and 85  per cent of social work enrolments in higher education.24 Many 
students in these cohorts also juggle full -time or part -time study with paid work as 
well as caring and parental responsibilities.  
Completion rates for teachers, nurses and social workers have d eclined over the 
decade. Four -year completion rates show that for teaching students commencing in 
2005, the completion rate was 55.4  per cent, and 40.9  per cent for social workers. 
For students commencing in 2019, the four -year completion rate for teachers  had 
fallen to 30.1  per cent, and 26.3  per cent for social work.25 Similarly, the four -year 
completion rate for nursing fell from 64.3  per cent to 54.1  per cent over the same 
period. These degrees require lengthy, mandatory placements, which are an 
essenti al part of study and preparedness for the workplace, but often act as a 
disincentive to completing the qualification.  
The Government is providing a Commonwealth Prac Payment for eligible students 
to mitigate financial hardship faced while completing mandatory placements in 
nursing and midwifery, teaching and social work courses leading to these important 
professions. The payments have been designed to target those who need the 
financial assistance the most, noting these education pathways a lso have high 
representation of First  Nations, regional and remote, and mature aged students.  
 Economic equality and security   |  Page 43 Economic equality and security  
 
There have been significant improvements in women’s economic equality and 
security in recent dec ades. More women are attaining higher educational 
qualifications and participating in the workforce, increasing financial independence. 
However, gaps persist between women’s and men’s economic outcomes. The gender 
pay gap remains significant and women are retiring with lower superannuation 
balances.  
In Working for Women: A Strategy for Gender Equality  (Working for Women ), the 
Government has committed to a number of objectives to reach its ambition to 
achieve economic equality. This includes closing the gen der pay gap; reducing 
gender segregation within industries and occupations; ending gender 
discrimination, sexual harassment and violence in the workplace; and closing the 
retirement income gap.  
This Budget includes actions which will drive change and make further progress 
towards achieving economic equality and security for all women in Australia, whilst 
also delivering cost -of-living relief . All 6.5  million women taxpayers will receive a 
tax cut from 1  July 2024, which will provide cost -of-living support f or low - to 
middle -income families and reduce disincentives  for women to take on more hours 
of work. The Government is also addressing cost -of-living pressures through further 
increasing the maximum rates of Commonwealth Rent Assistance and delivering 
addit ional energy bill relief to all households.  
The Government is committed to reducing workforce gender segregation as part of 
creating a future made in Australia. These investments include $ 55.6 million to 
launch the Building Women’s Careers program to create structural and cultural 
change in male -dominated workplaces so more women pursue careers in key high 
demand industries. The Government is also investing $38.2  million over  eight years 
to support a thriving, skilled and diverse STEM workforce. These investments are in 
addition to the Commonwealth Prac Payments, highlighted in Chapter  2: Unpaid and 
paid care , which provide support for eligible students in nursing and midwifery, 
teaching and social work courses while they attend mandatory placements. 
Additionally, the Government is capping indexation of Higher Education Loan 
Program (HELP) debt to the lower of the Consumer Price Index or Wage Price Index, 
which will benefit more women who hold the majority of HELP debts.  
The Government is investing in wo men’s economic security by paying 
superannuation on Government -funded Paid Parental Leave for births or adoptions 
on or after 1  July 2025. This is a key step towards reducing the retirement savings 
gap and improving the fairness of Australia’s retirement i ncome system.

Providing cost -of-living relief to women and families  
High cost -of-living pressures are being felt broadly across the community. The Government 
recognises that households differ in their capacity to cope with cost -of-living pressures. 
For this reason, it is continuing its cost -of-living support to help relieve pressure on 
households. This support is particularly important for single women, who are almost twice 
as likely to face indicators of financial stress compared with coupled households.  
The Government’s cost -of-living tax cuts will deliver tax relief to all Australian taxpayers 
from 1  July 2024. All 6.5  million women taxpayers will receive a tax cut in 2024 –25, 
benefitting by  an average amount of around $1,650 relative to 2023 –24 settings. Compared 
with previously legislated settings, 5.8  million women taxpayers (90  per cent of women 
taxpayers) will receive a larger tax cut under the Government’s tax plan, with an average 
additional tax cut of $707.  
People in female -dominated occupations, such as teaching, nursing and aged care, are also 
among the most likely to benefit from the tax changes, with over 95  per cent of these 
taxpayers receiving more tax relief compared to the previously legislated settings.  Women's Budget Statement   |   
 
Economic equality and security   |  Page 45 
The Government’s tax cuts are expected to raise labour supply , particularly for women. 
Within households, a combination  of factors can influence individual decisions to 
participate in the labour market, and the extent to which people work. Women are more 
likely to be lower income earners and the interactions between the tax and transfer system 
can create additional disince ntives for women to participate as fully as they wish to. 
As such, the same change to tax rates can produce different labour supply responses 
between men and women.  
Women, particularly women with children, are more likely to adjust their work hou rs in 
response to changed tax rates than men. People with less formal education and those with 
reduced potential to earn higher incomes are also more responsive to changes in after -tax 
incomes than other cohorts.  
By directing more tax relief to people on low -and m iddle -incomes, the Government’s tax 
changes are expected to raise women’s labour supply by around 630,000 hours per  week. 
This is more than double that expected under the previously legislated settings (around 
230,000 hours). This increase is being driven by increases in hours worked and greater 
participation of women with taxable incomes between $20,000 and $75,000.  
The Government’s tax cuts build on other government initiatives that support women’s 
workforce participation, including the Cheaper Child Care  reforms that came into effect in 
July 2023.    |  Women's Budget Statement

Box 8: Cameos – Cost -of-living tax cuts and Cheaper Child Care reforms1 
The new cost -of-living tax cuts from 1  July 2024, and the Government’s Cheaper 
Child Care reforms, which came into effect in July  2023, will offer cost -of-living 
support by allowing low - to middle - income families to keep more of what 
they  earn.   
Example 1:  Rebecca is working full -time on the national minimum wage ($45,906) 
and is a sole parent of a three -year -old child who attends l ong day care five days 
per week. She is a recipient of the Parenting Payment Single. Under the 
Government’s changes, Rebecca will receive a tax cut of $1,077 and an additional 
$1,625 in Child Care Subsidy. In total, Rebecca’s benefit is $2,702 , equivalent to a 
5.0 per cent increase in her disposable income.  
Example 2:  Yumna works part -time  three days a week earning  $35,925  and her 
partner works full -time earning $67,646 . Together, Yumna and her partner have a 
combined household annual income of $103,571. Th e couple have a three -year -old 
who attends centre -based long day care three days a week and a nine -year -old who 
attends outside school hours care for three days a week. With the Government’s 
changes, the couple will receive a tax cut of $1,902 and an addit ional $2,043  in Child 
Care Subsidy. The couple’s net benefit from the tax cuts and increased Child  Care 
Subsidy is $3,945, equivalent to a 4. 7 per cent increase in their disposable income.  
  
— 
1  Examples are based on estimated tax and transfer policy settings for the 2024 –25 income 
year. Households are assumed: not to be renting; not to have a HECS –HELP debt; to only 
receive private income from employment; to hold suitable private health cover and  not to be 
paying the Medicare levy surcharge. In both examples, t he three -year -old child is in long day 
care for ten hours per  day on the same days worked by the sole parent or the part-time 
worker , for 50 weeks per  year, at a cost of $12.85 per  hour. In example 2, t he nine -year -old 
child attends outside school hours care for five hours per  day on the same days worked by 
the part-time worker , for 40 weeks per  year, at a cost of $8.80 per  hour. In example 2, the 
part-time worker  is earning the female median  taxable income in 2021 –22 while her partner 
earns the m edian taxable income  in 2021 –22. Income tax includes the impact of personal tax 
rates and thresholds, the Medicare levy, as well as relevant tax offsets including the low 
income tax offset and beneficiary tax offset. Disposable income is the income available to a 
person or household inclusive of their private income and transfer payments, after income 
tax and net of child  care costs.  Women's Budget Statement   |   
 
Economic equality and securi ty  |  Page 47 
The Government is also addressing cost -of-living pressures through further increasing the 
maximum rates of Commonwealth Rent Assistance by 10  per cent and delivering $300 in 
additional energy bill relief to more than 10.0 million households.  
Increases in the cost of housing put more women, particularly single women, at risk of 
experiencing rental stress. The increase to maximum rates of C ommonwealth Rent 
Assistance  responds to recommendations from the Economic Inclusion Advisory 
Committee. The 2024 –25 Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee  report notes th at renters 
are at a greater risk of financial stress and poverty and many Australians on income 
support find their incomes heavily absorbed by rent. As at March  2024, C ommonwealth 
Rent Assistance  reduces the incidence of rental stress amongst recipients by  around 
31 percent age poin ts.    |  Women's Budget Statement

Budget highlights: Cost of living relief to households  
Cost-of-living Tax Cuts  
From 1  July 2024, the Government is delivering tax cuts to all 13.6  million Australian 
taxpayers, including all 6.5  million women who pay income  tax. Compared to 
previously legislated settings, 11.5  million taxpayers will receive a bigger tax cut, 
including 5.8  million women taxpayers. The Government’s tax changes are desi gned 
to provide cost -of-living relief to middle Australia without adding to the inflation 
outlook, return bracket creep, and boost labour supply, particularly for women.  
Commonwealth Rent Assistance  
The Government is increasing the maximum rates of Common wealth Rent 
Assistance by 10  per cent. This builds on the Government’s increase to 
Commonwealth Rent Assistance  in the last Budget and will help address rental 
affordability challenges for recipients. Stable and affordable housing is a key enabler 
of meaningful economic and social participation. The Government provides 
Commonwealth Rent Assistance  to income support  recipients and those on Family 
Tax Benefit Part A renting privately or in community housing to assist with the cost 
of housing . 
This will support a significant number of women experiencing rental stress. The 
change benefits a number of vulnerable groups, including single women households 
who are 51  per cent of households eligible for the maximum C ommonwealth Rent 
Assistance  rate. Single women households are more vulnerable to rental stress due 
to the gender pay gap, responsibilities as single parents and d isproportionately 
facing family and domestic violence. Around 200,000  households who stand to 
benefit from the increase are couple households , with the benefit flowing to women 
in these households too.  
Energy Bill Relief Fund  
The Government is continuing to shield households and small businesses from 
energy price increases, providing $ 3.5 billion  in additional energy bill relief and 
expanding eligibility from 5.0 million to more than 10.0 million  households. From 
1 July 2024, all households will receive re bates of $ 300 on their electricity bills and 
around 1.0 million eligible small businesses will receive $ 325. This is in addition to 
the up to  $1.5 billion  committed in Budget 2023 –24, which provided targeted relief 
for around 5.0 million households and 1.0 million small businesses.  
Reducing  student debt  
The Government is  capping indexation of student debt to the lower of the Consumer 
Price Index or the Wage Price Index , so that growth in debt does not outpace wages 
growth.  Of the around $3 .0 billion  in stud ent debt expected to be written off, more 
than half of this is  held by women.

Building a gender -balanced workforce for a  future made in 
Australia  
In building the skills Australia needs for the workforce of the future, the Government is 
taking action t o ensure that women are well  represented across all  key industries.  
A future made in Australia requires a highly skilled and diverse workforce. Currently 
women are under -represented in industries that will support Australia’s net -zero 
transition. Within the clean energy industry, women make up 35  per cent of the 
workforce.26 For some o ccupations, the numbers are much lower. In 2022, women made up 
only 6  per cent of solar installers, 8  per cent of energy efficiency engineers and 4  per cent of 
wind turbine technicians.27 Construction is Australia’s second most male -dominated 
industry, aft er mining, with women making up only 26  per cent of the workforce.28  
Reducing gender segregation in these industries  requires more women and girls in science, 
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. In 202 1, women made up only 
37 per cent of enrolments in university STEM courses and 17  per cent of vocational 
education and training STEM enrolments.29 In the same year, women represented only 
15 per cent of Australia’s STEM workforce.30 
Reducing workforce gender segregation is integral to addressing and preventing skills 
shortages in high -growth industries. It is likely that there will need to be a 127  per cent 
increase in Australia’s clean energy supply workforce by 2033 to achieve Australia’s 
legislated target of net zero emissions by 2050.31 Increasing women’s participation in 
currently male -dominated industries can help address skill shortages by sup porting 
increased labour mobility and expanding the talent pool for businesses to draw on.  
Workforce gender segregation is driven by undervaluation of many feminised jobs, 
structural and cultural barriers to women’s participation in male -dominated industri es, the 
unequal division of unpaid care work within households and education and career choices 
influenced by gender stereotypes.  
The Government’s investments to create a future made in Australia will seek to address 
these drivers of workforce gender segr egation to ensure that women share in the jobs of the 
future.  The Australian Skills Guarantee, which comes into effect on 1  July 2024, will help to 
increase the number of women working on major Government -funded construction and 
ICT projects, and investmen ts via the new National Skills Agreement and Fee -Free TAFE 
will improve access and support VET completion rates for women.  
The Commonwealth and state and territory governments’ Fee -Free TAFE initiative is 
continuing to exceed targets and remove financial b arriers to training and upskilling. 
Fee-Free TAFE is targeted towards priority cohorts, including women facing economic 
insecurity, women undertaking study in non -traditional fields and unpaid carers. In 2023, 
more than 355,000 Australians enrolled in Fee -Free TAFE, surpassing the initial first year 
target of 180,000 places, with 62  per cent of these enrolments by women. As part of the 
Fee-Free TAFE commitment, a further 300,000 places are available from 2024 to 2026.    |  Women's Budget Statement

In addition, the Government is continu ing to address current and emerging workforce 
skills and training needs through Jobs and Skills Australia. Jobs and Skills Australia has a 
legislative function to provide advice on opportunities to remove barriers to gender 
equality in the provision of tra ining and in the labour market, to improve gender equality 
outcomes.   
This Budget builds on these investments in skills and training, by establishing the Building 
Women’s Careers program to increase women’s participation in construction, clean energy 
and a dvanced manufacturing sectors. This Budget also includes funding to scale up the 
Government’s Women in STEM and science engagement programs, which will enable more 
women to make the most of opportunities in growing industries, such as technology, 
renewable  energy and quantum.  
Budget highlights: Reducing industry gender segregation for a future 
made in  Australia  
Building Women’s Careers program  
The Government will invest $ 55.6 million over four  years, commencing in 2024 –25, 
in the Building Women’s Careers program which will drive structural and systemic 
change in training and work environments. The program will fund large -scale 
projects and smaller, place -based partnerships to improve women’s ac cess to 
flexible, safe and inclusive training and work opportunities in key male -dominated 
industries. The Government will work with women’s services, industry, employers, 
training providers across target industries and sectors including construction, clea n 
energy, advanced manufacturing, digital and technology to support women and 
create the conditions for them to train and take up jobs in these sectors. This will 
help to build a future made in Australia and help to address barriers to women’s 
participatio n in priority industries. Around ten large -scale projects and several 
smaller projects will be funded by the program through a grants process.  
Diversity in STEM  
In February  2024, the Government released the independent Pathway to Diversity in 
STEM Review f inal recommendations report. The report makes 11 recommendations 
on how policies and programs can help overcome cultural and structural barriers 
that limit women and girls, and other under -represented groups, from participating 
in STEM education and career s. 
In response to the Pathway to Diversity in STEM Review, the Government is 
providing $38.2  million over eight  years from 2023 –24 (and $1.3  million ongoing) to 
support a thriving, skilled and diverse STEM workforce. This funding will scale up 
Women in STE M and science engagement programs that are creating positive 
change to attract and retain more women, and other under -represented groups, in 
STEM education and jobs.

MYEFO highlights: Supporting women’s skills development  
The new five -year National Skills Agreement with all states and territories 
commenced on 1  January  2024, with gender equality  identified as one of the national 
priorities. The National Skills Agreement will see the Commonwealth Government 
invest up to $12.6  billion  in state  and territory training systems, taking the total 
combined investment to $30 .0 billion . $250.0  million of  Commonwealth funding, to 
be matched by states and territories, is dedicated to improving VET qualification 
completion rates for women as well as other  cohorts who face completion 
challenges. Governments will work collaboratively and purposefully towards this 
national priority and will apply focussed effort to addressing gender equality in the 
VET sector. The National Skills Agreement commits to deliver training for critical 
industries, including essential care services.  
 
Making student loans fairer  
The Government is also ensuring that women benefit from the changing workforce needs 
of the future by acting on the recommendations of the Australian Univers ities Accord. 
This  includes supporting students during and after their study, through the new 
Commonwealth Prac Payment for nursing and midwifery, teaching and social work 
students, and reforms to make student loans fairer so all Australians can access hig her 
education without upfront fees.  
The Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) system has supported increased access to 
higher education without upfront fees, including for women. Australian women are now 
more educated than ever before, and increasingly, mo re educated than men. 36 per cent of 
women aged 15 –74 held a bachelor’s degree or above in 2023, compared with 28  per cent of 
men.32 Despite more women obtaining higher education qualifications than men, a gender 
pay gap is present on women’s entry to the workforce. In 2017, men’s undergraduate 
median starting salaries were greater than women’s in 16 out of 20 fields of education.33 
This can impact women’s ability to repay their HELP debt.  
Around 61.1  per cent of HELP debtors are women, equivalent to nearly 2.0 million people.34 
Women also hold 58.5  per cent of the total amount of outstanding HELP debt. Women are 
more impacted by increases in indexation rates as they typically take longer to repay their 
HELP debt. Women’s ability to repay debt is affected by historic  underpayment  in 
feminised industries, occupational segregation, and because they take more time out of the 
workforce to undertake unpaid care.  
The Government is capping indexation of HELP debt to the lower of the Consumer Price 
Index or Wage Price Index, which will be nefit women and make student loans fairer.    |  Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 52  |  Economic equality and security  
Budget highlights: Making the HELP system fairer and investing in 
women’s skills  
This Budget makes the HELP system fairer, including for women. To ensure that 
growth in HELP debts does not outpace wages growth, th e Government will cap 
indexation of HELP debts to the lower of the Consumer Price Index or Wage Price 
Index. The change in indexation will be retroactively applied from 1  June  2023, 
reducing indexation in 2023 from 7.1  per cent to 3.2  per cent for more tha n 
3.0 million individuals with outstanding HELP, VET Student Loan, Australian 
Apprenticeship Support Loan and other student support loan accounts at that time.  
 
Narrowing the gender pay gap  
The national gender pay gap monitored by the Australian Bureau of  Statistics, which 
measures the difference in base salary earnings between women and men in full -time work, 
has fallen for the third consecutive time to a record low of 12.0  per cent in November  2023. 
Progress over the last 12 months is partly attributable  to a strong outcome for award wages 
from the annual wage review and newly implemented enterprise agreements for essential 
workers in the health care and social assistance and education and training industries, 
which generally have a higher proportion of w omen. Women’s average weekly ordinary 
time earnings increased 5.5  per cent in 2023, compared with growth of 4.0  per cent for men.  
Despite this progress, the gender gap remains significant. Women working full -time earn, 
on average, $238 less per  week than men working full -time. This is a difference of around 
$12,376  per year. When total remuneration for full -time, part -time and casual employees is 
considered, the gender pay gap is greater. The Workplace Gender Equality Agency 
(WGEA) calculates the average t otal remuneration gap for employees in organisations with 
100 or more employees at 21.7  per cent in 2022 –23.35 Total remuneration includes base 
salary, superannuation, overtime, bonuses, and other additional payments, with part -time 
and casual roles conver ted into annualised full -time equivalent earnings.  
This gap is driven by a range of factors, including differences in gender representation and 
remuneration across occupations and industries, the impact of caring responsibilities on 
patterns of work, and gender discrimination and bias. These factors are complex, 
interrelated and can often compound over a woman’s lifetime.  
There is a clear link between more women in management and in executive leadership 
positions, such as directors, CEOs and key managemen t personnel, and a lower gender pay 
gap. This is not only because women managers and executives are paid more than the 
average employee; employers with women CEOs have, on average, lower gender pay gaps 
even when their pay is not included in the calculatio n.36 Despite this, in 2021 there were 
almost twice as many men than women in Australia’s highest paid 5  per cent of 
occupations.37 Women's Budget Statement   |   
 
Economic equality and security   |  Page 53 
Reporting employer gender pay gaps  
Following amendments to the Workplace  Gender  Equality  Act 2012  in 2023, the Government 
has taken action to close the gender pay gap through publishing employer gender pay gap 
data. In February  2024, WGEA published, for the first time, the gender pay gaps for private 
sector employers with 100 or more employees in 2022 –23. The dataset captures the gender 
pay gaps for almost 5,000 Australian private sector employers, covering almost five million 
employees.  
The Government’s decision to publish employer gender pay gaps is a catalyst for change, 
bringing transparency and a ccountability as well as creating healthy competition among 
peers. For employers, it is an opportunity to reconsider how they hire, promote, retain and 
remunerate their staff. For employees, it equips them with the information they need when 
choosing emplo yers and to raise questions with their current employer. In early 2025, 
WGEA will publish Commonwealth Government employer gender pay gaps.  
Women’s workforce participation  
Reducing barriers to women’s labour force participation is central to improving wome n’s 
economic equality and security. Women’s workforce participation has increased 
significantly over the past 40 years, from 44.6  per cent in 1984 to 62.6  per cent in 2024.38 
Younger generations of women are now more likely to participate in the workforce,  and for 
longer (Chart  3.1).  
Recent strength in the labour market has improved prospects for cohorts who have 
traditionally faced barriers to employment. Women’s labour force participation rate rose 
to a record high in November  2023 at 63.1  per cent, alon g with a record high 
employment -to-population ratio of 60.7  per cent.  
The increase in participation has been driven by changing social attitudes, increased 
educational attainment for women, increased flexibility offered by employers, and caring 
work movin g into the formal economy. Government action aims to break down barriers to 
participation. This action includes the Cheaper Child Care reforms, broadening access to 
early childhood education and care, reforming the Government -funded Paid Parental 
Leave sch eme and investing in skills development. In addition, the Government is 
implementing a new voluntary pre -employment service for disadvantaged parents of 
children under six years of age from 1  November  2024, following the abolition of 
ParentsNext .

Budget highlights: Better eviden ce for better  outcomes  
The Government is taking steps to improve the measurement of wellbeing, 
disaggregate social  trends by cohort, and to drive new outcomes -focussed policy 
approaches that prioritise meaningful results for people and communities.  
• The Gov ernment ’s $100 .0 million Outcomes Fund will be established from  
2024 –25 to fund  projects aimed at supporting those experiencing entrenched 
disadvantage. The Fund will focus on  three  key areas: improving outcomes for 
children and families; helping those experiencing barriers to employment; and, 
improving access to services for people facing or experiencing homelessness. 
Consideration will be given to projects that align with the Gover nment ’s strategic 
priorities, including gender equality . 
• The Government released Measuring What Matters, Australia’s National 
Wellbeing Framework, in July  2023 to put people and progress, fairness and 
opportunity at the very core of thinking about the econ omy and society, now and 
into the future.  The Government has committed to $14.8  million over five years  
to deliver the General Social Survey on an annual basis for timely insights on the 
wellbeing of Australians. This funding will also increase the sample of the 
General Social Survey to ensure the overarching themes of inclusion, fairness and 
equity are representative for all segments of the Australian population. It will 
increase the data that is available  by gender, strengthen ing the capacity of the 
Frame work to identify opportunities to improve wellbeing and inform policy 
change.  
 
Women in Australia have not experienced equal progress  
Workforce participation by First  Nations women, women with disability and refugee 
women has increased over time (Chart  3.2). However, unique and diverse barriers to work 
mean labour market outcomes for these cohorts continue to lag, with employment rates 
well below the national average.    |  Women's Budget Statement

In 2020, the Wiyi Yani U Thangani  (Women’s Voices) Report identified several barriers to 
employment and economic participation for First  Nations women including: extensive 
family and communit y roles and a lack of job opportunities in remote areas. Within 
workplaces, First  Nations women experience a lack of diversity across sectors and roles, 
impediments to employment and career progression, a lack of respect and cultural safety, 
and inadequate  supports in the workplace.  
While participation rates for First  Nations women rose to 58  per cent in 2021 (up from 
51 per cent in 2006), a gap remains. As of 2021, workforce participation rates for 
First  Nations women were 17.7  percent age points  lower tha n that of other women in 
Australia. Although, the gap in the employment rate between First  Nations people and 
other Australians narrowed with higher levels of education. Furthermore, First  Nations 
women with a Bachelor degree or higher had a higher full -time employment rate than 
other women, with a gap of 5.4  percentage points.39  Women's Budget Statement   |

Budget highlights: Increasing economic opportunities in remote areas  
The Government is investing $ 777.4  million  over five years from 2023 –24 (and 
$255.5  million per  year ongoing ) in a new Remote Jobs and Economic Development 
Program to create up to 3,000 jobs in remote Australia and support income support 
recipients move into paid employment.  Funding includes  establishing a Community 
Jobs and Business Fund  to support  commu nity development and the creation of 
employment opportunities through funding capital, equipment and capacity 
building services . It will be developed in partnership with First  Nations people 
commenc ing in the second half of 2024 . It is the first step by Go vernment to 
replace  the Community Development Program  with  real jobs, proper wages and 
decent conditions.  
 
Employment supports many people with disability to have more control over their lives, be 
financially independent and improve their standard of living. This  can have positive 
impacts on their mental and physical health and wellbeing. The intersection of gender 
inequality and disability discrimination means women with disability experience unique 
challenges entering the workforce, working to their capacity, or being supported to remain 
in the workforce. Women with disability have poorer employment outcomes and 
experience lower labour force participation rates, higher rates of casual employment and 
lower pay than men with disability, and women withou t disability. Employed women with 
disability are also almost twice as likely to be working part -time (54  per cent), compared 
with men with disability (28  per cent).40  
To enhance support for people with disability, this Budget includes $227.6  million over 
five years to implement a new specialist disability employment program to replace the 
existing program by 1 July 2025.    |  Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 58  |  Economic equality and security  
Gender analysis in practice: A new disability employment program  
Labour force participation is lower for women with disability than for m en with 
disability, and women with disability are also more likely to be casually employed 
than men.41 To address these imbalances, the design of the new specialist disability 
employment program will reduce barriers and improve the tailoring of support, 
enabling more women with disability to participate.  
The changes will have a positive impact on advancing gender equality by improving 
access to employment support for women with disability. In particular, the more 
flexible service offering of the new program  will allow women to stay connected to 
the program and continue receiving support while also balancing other 
responsibilities. This is expected to benefit women who have caring responsibilities, 
are working part -time or who contribute to their community in  other ways.  
The new specialist disability employment  program will also provide more tailored 
support, which will benefit women looking for work or wanting to increase their 
participation . Up to an additional 1,900 women per  year are anticipated to 
partic ipate in the program as a result of expanding eligibility to include people 
with  a future work capacity of under eight hours per  week. Up to an additional 
5,000  women per  year are anticipated to enter the program as a result of removing 
the requirement to be on an income support payment.  
 
Workforce participation for migrant and refugee women has increased over the last decade 
but remains significantly lower than for migrant and refugee men and Australian -born 
women. Issues of gender discrimination and bias are magnified for migrant women. They 
are more likely to be secondary visa holders, often to their male partners. They can also face 
difficulty having their qualifications recognised and, as a result, finding work t o match 
their skills. Other challenges faced by migrant and refugee women in entering the 
workforce can include limited language proficiency and cultural differences (for example, 
in relation to child care and domestic responsibilities).  
 Women's Budget Statement   |   
 
Economic equality and security   |  Page 59 
Budget highlight s: Empowering migrant and refugee women  
The Government will provide $15.0  million over three years from 2024 –25 for 
information and education activities  to provide migrant  workers  with accurate and 
appropriate information about workplace safeguards , prote ctions and compliance 
measures related to migration law s. This will empower migrant women, who are 
over -represented in insecure work, to report allegations of worker exploitation 
without fear of reprisals.  
The Government also will provide $3.8  million over  four years from 2024 –25 to 
continue conversational English classes in Community Hubs. These classes remove a 
barrier for many migrant women accessing English language support through the 
provision of on -site childminding facilities.  
 
Enhancing lifetime economic security and gender equality  
Throughout a woman’s lifetime, lower hourly and weekly earnings and lower wealth 
accumulation compound to produce lower superannuation balances  and less economic 
security in retirement. Women aged 60 to 64 have a medi an superannuation balance 
25 per cent less than men of the same age. Although this difference is narrowing over time, 
as long as women have lower workforce participation and lower incomes than men, 
a gender gap in superannuation balances will remain (Chart  3.3).  
The Women’s Economic Equality Taskforce recommended paying superannuation on 
Paid  Parental Leave (PPL) to help reduce the gender wealth and superannuation gap. 
Additionally, Wiyi Yani U Thangani  (Women’s Voices) Implementation Framework 
identified paying superannuation on PPL as a policy action to make superannuation 
schemes fairer for First  Nations women.    |  Women's Budget Statement

Budget highlights: Paying Superannuation on Government -funded Paid 
Parental Leave  
The Government is provid ing $1 .1 billion  over four years from 2024 –25 and 
$0.6 billion  per year from 2028 –29 to pay superannuation on Government -funded 
Paid Parental Leave (PPL) for births or adoptions on or after 1  July 2025.  
The Government -funded PPL scheme signals that taking time out of the paid 
workforce to care for a child is part of the usual course of life and w ork for both 
parents. Adding a superannuation payment to PPL recognises the contribution 
parents make to society.  
All recipients of Government -funded PPL will be eligible for the payment, 
regardless of gender, with the majority of Government -funded PPL sc heme 
recipients being women. In 2022 –23, around 66  per cent of recipients were women.  
Paying an annual superannuation payment of 12  per cent on the full partnered 
entitlement of 22 weeks will increase a median earning mother’s superannuation 
balance at ret irement by around $4,250 or 1.15  per cent. This is a key step towards 
reducing the retirement savings gap and improving the fairness of Australia’s 
retirement income system, and an important signal that care is valued.  
 Health   |  Page 63 Health  
Australia has one of the best health systems in the world, supporting Australians to 
experience some of the best health outcomes. However, women and girls continue to 
experience gender bias in the health system, which can lead to poorer health 
outcomes like delayed diagnosis and treatment, over -prescribing medications and 
dismissal of pain. The symptoms of heart failure, for example, are less likely to be 
recognised in women than in men, and older women are more likely than men to 
have prescriptions for five or more medications.  In addition, women are more likely 
to have a ch ronic condition and require more time with their general practitioner, 
which can lead to higher out -of-pocket costs for healthcare.  
Women and girls can face stigma on a range of health issues from menstruation to 
miscarriage to menopause. A more gender eq uitable system is vital for improving 
women’s health outcomes and is a measure of a well -functioning healthcare  system.  
Through Working for Women: A Strategy for Gender Equality , the Government has 
committed to a number of outcomes to reach its ambition t o achieve gender equity in 
healthcare . The outcomes include:  
• the healthcare  system recognising and being responsive to gendered health 
issues and provides women and men with increased access to information, 
diagnosis, treatment and services  
• women hav ing choice and access to safe and affordable maternal, sexual and 
reproductive healthcare  
• improving the mental health of women, men and gender diverse people.  
The Government is advancing efforts to improve the accessibility and affordability 
of health care for  Australian women throughout the different stages of their lives. 
Over their lifetime, women spend more on out -of-pocket healthcare costs than men 
and are more likely to defer or skip care because of costs. New initiatives in this 
Budget aim to reduce gend er bias in the healthcare system , improve affordability of 
essential healthcare and medicines , and improve access to maternal, sexual and 
reproductive health services. The Government will also provide trauma -informed 
local outreach healthcare in crisis and temporary accommodation services for 
women and children experiencing family, domestic and sexual violence.

Gender equity and health  
Gender is a key social determinant of health, with women facing different obstacles in 
accessing healthcare  compared to men. Women are more likely to be at risk of ill health 
than men in all stages of life.42 The National Women ’s Health Strategy 2020 –2030  (Women’s 
Health Strategy) outlines a national approach to improving health outcomes for all women 
and girls and aims to reduce inequities.  The Government is committed  to improving 
women ’s health across their lifetime , recognising that women and girls can experience a 
range of diver se health needs and risk s across  their lives . The Government is also working 
to establish the ten -year National Action Plan for the health and wellbeing of LGBTIQA+ 
people.  Women's Budget Statement   |   
 
Health   |  Page 65 
To contribute to our understanding of gender bias in the health system, the Govern ment 
established the National Women’s Health Advisory Council (Council) in February  2023. 
The Council provides strategic advice and recommendations directly to Government to 
improve health outcomes for Australian women and girls and advice on implementatio n of 
the Women’s Health Strategy. The Council undertook the #EndGenderBias survey to better 
understand the unique barriers and gender biases women face in Australia’s healthcare  
system. The survey found two -thirds of women experienced healthcare  related ge nder bias 
or discrimination and almost 80  per cent of caregivers reported that a person they cared for 
had similar experiences.43 
Consistent themes from the survey included women feeling dismissed and disbelieved, 
being stereotyped due to their gender, and  women’s symptoms being readily attributed to 
other causes such as menstruation and lifestyle factors. Women from diverse backgrounds 
were more likely to experience bias. A higher number (80  per cent) of women with 
disability and LGBTIQA+ respondents repor ted discrimination and bias compared to 
around 67  per cent of other women.  
For the first time, the Government is addressing the complex and systemic bias against 
women in the healthcare system. Quality health data is needed to develop strong 
evidence -based  policy and better understand the gap between women’s experiences 
seeking healthcare , and healthcare  professionals’ understanding of people’s needs.   
Budget highlights: Better research and data on women’s health  
• Through an updated Medical Research Future F und 10 -year Investment Plan, the 
Government is allocating $53.6  million over four years from 2024 –25 for research 
into health priorities such as women’s health including menopause, pregnancy 
loss and infertility.  
• The Government is also providing $8 .0 million over three years from 2024 –25 to 
support the development of  datasets on miscarriages, sexual and reproductive 
health, as well as evaluation activities for early pregnancy assessment services. 
Enhancing data collection and evidence will help inform future women’s health 
policy.  
 
Improving women’s access to care and medicines  
Access to new and affordable medicines is critical to support good health outcomes for 
Australians. Across most of the income spectrum, women spend more out -of-pocket than 
men.44  
The Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) Continuous Review Program will consider the 
appropriateness of a number of MBS items to ensure they support equitable and affordable 
access for Australian women. The review will also consider how high -quality, safe s ervices   |  Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 66  |  Health  
can be provided by appropriately trained health practitioners, including doctors, nurse 
practitioners and nurses.  
The Government has continued to invest in treatments for women’s health conditions 
through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme  (PBS) in cluding through this Budget to 
support  a new medicine for breast cancer.  
Budget highlights: More affordable breast cancer treatment  
The Government remains committed to providing Australians with affordable and 
timely access to medicines through the PBS. From 1  May  2024, access to  abemaciclib 
(Verzenio®) will be expanded on the PBS to treat patients with a type of early breast 
cancer that has a high risk of returning. Without subsidy, this treatment could cost 
individuals around $97,000 per  course. Th e listing of this treatment means that 
eligible individuals will pay a maximum of only $31.60  per script , or just $7.70 with a 
concession card. The expanded listing of Verzenio® is expected to benefit around 
2,400 Australians each year.  
 
Sexual and reprod uctive health  
Women have unique health experiences, risks and needs across their lifetimes, such as 
during puberty, pregnancy, motherhood, perimenopause and menopause. The 
#EndGenderBias Survey highlighted that many women do not always receive support 
from  health professionals when discussing these issues. Gender bias was reported most 
often by women seeking care for sexual and reproductive health issues and chronic pain.45  
Access, cost barriers and feelings of shame can contribute to women not seeking med ical 
care for sexual and reproductive health issues such as infections. Serious sexual and 
reproductive health consequences from undiagnosed and untreated infections include 
ectopic pregnancy, foetal and neonatal deaths, pelvic inflammatory disease and inf ertility.  Women's Budget Statement   |   
 
Health   |  Page 67 
Budget highlights: Improving quality of care with longer consults on 
the MBS  
• Telehealth services by general practitioners and prescribed medical practitioners 
specifically for blood borne virus and sexual and reproductive health services 
will tra nsition from temporary to permanent MBS items from 1  July 2024. 
Telehealth services for sexual and reproductive health can address unmet clinical 
need, support vulnerable populations and enable access to time -critical treatment 
such as medical termination.   
• To support more timely diagnosis and ongoing management for women 
impacted by endometriosis and other complex gynaecological condition s,  
$49.1 million over four years is being provided for longer gynaecology 
consultations. From 1  July 2025, the addition of two new MBS items will allow 
patients with suspected endometriosis and pelvic pain to access subsidised 
consultations of 45 minutes or longer with gynaecologists.  
 
Enhancing contraception choice and access  
The ability for women to choose if and when they have children is a fundamental human 
right, and central to women’s empowerment and involvement in their communities. 
Approximately 70  per cent of Australian women of reproductive age are using some form 
of contraception.46 Despite t his, an estimated one -third have an unplanned pregnancy at 
some point in their lives.47 This has been partially attrib uted  to low uptake of more effective 
long -acting reversible contraception (LARC), due to low awareness and limited access to 
health practi tioners providing this service. The cost and availability of LARC training is a 
significant barrier to service delivery in primary care settings, particularly for intrauterine 
devices. 
A key priority of the Women’s Health Strategy  is to increase access to sexual and 
reproductive health information. The Council has also identified empowerment as one of 
its key focus areas to improve health outcomes for women and girls. Many women make 
decisions about their preferred contraception before visiting a healthcare  provider, so 
access to comprehensive, medically accurate, and consistent information, particularly 
online, is essential to support informed decision -making.  
A gender audit of Medicare rebates, as part of the MBS Continuous Review Program, will 
look specif ically at MBS items for LARC insertion and removal, as well as any gendered 
differences across diagnostic imaging rebates.    |  Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 68  |  Health  
Budget highlights: Giving women more contraception choice  
• The Government will provide $5 .2 million over three years from 2024 –25 to 
support placement costs for health practitioners , including regional and remote 
practitioners, to undertake training in LARC insertion and removal. This will 
increase the number of healthcare practitioners trained in LARC so women have 
more access to these highly effective, reversible forms of contraception.  
• The Government will provide $ 1.1 million over four years from 2024 –25 to 
support the develop ment of a virtual contraception decision -making tool for 
women and health practitioners.  
 
Improving access to period products  
Purchasing sexual and reproductive health products and services is not affordable for all 
women. Despite the removal of the goods  and services tax on period products in 
January  2019, the cost of period products remains a  barrier for many women and girls. 
Women living in remote communities can experience barriers to accessing period products 
due to travelling greater distances, and remoteness can increase the cost of period products 
as much as 100  per cent.48 This issue pa rticularly impacts First  Nations women and girls, as 
the proportion of the First  Nations population increases with remoteness (from 1.9  per cent 
in major cities to 32  per cent in remote and very remote areas).49  
Research has shown that some girls in remote communities may skip school for several 
days during their periods, because period products are unaffordable or unavailable, or 
buying period products is too shameful.50  
Budget highlight s: Improving access to pe riod products  
• The Government will provide $12. 5 million over four years from 2024 –25 to the 
National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation to facilitate 
community -led, culturally appropriate distribution of free period products – 
including p ads, tampons and other products – to girls, women and gender 
diverse people in rural and remote First  Nations communities.  
• From 1  July 2024, the Government will abolish 457 nuisance tariffs in the largest 
unilateral tariff reform in two decades, to cut com pliance costs, reduce red tape, 
and improve outcomes for women. Tariffs will be eliminated on types of  
menstrual cups, menstrual underwear, and other goods . 
 Women's Budget Statement   |   
 
Health   |  Page 69 
Safe access to medical termination  
Access to pregnancy termination services is a key measure unde r the Women’s Health 
Strategy. The Government provides support for pregnancy termination services through 
MBS rebates for relevant services, including telehealth consultations, subsidies for the cost 
of medicines under the PBS and via the National Health R eform Agreement.  
The Government, supported by expert advice from the Therapeutic Goods Administration 
and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee , introduced changes to the 
dispensing and prescribing of the medical abortion drug, mifepristone and misoprostol  
(MS-2 Step©). This will reduce barriers to safe and affordable abortions, especially for 
women in rural and remote areas.  
Budget highlights: Improving access to affordable termination services  
The expansion of ultrasound imaging request rights for nurse practitioners under 
the MBS will enable them to request ultrasound s to support the before  and after  care 
for women who are accessing medical abortions. The use of ultrasound helps to 
ensure safet y and eligibility for the procedure. From  1 November  2024, these 
recommendations will be implemented to improve women’s access to safe and 
affordable termination services.  
 
MYEFO highlights: Supporting health practitioners  
The Government committed $1.1  million over four years from 2023 –24 for the 
Australian Contraception and Abortion Primary Care Practitioner Support Network 
(AusCAPPS) to support training and critical information to deliver essential 
women’s healthcare. The Network provides a free voluntar y online 
multidisciplinary Community of Practice which supports more than 2,400 eligible 
health practitioners who provide access to safe, affordable medical termination of 
pregnancy.  
 
Supporting women experiencing menopause  
A greater understanding of the  health needs of women affected by perimenopause and 
menopause has the potential to make a significant difference to the health outcomes of 
women. Menopause transition can affect women’s physical and mental health and 
increases risk for future cardiometabo lic health issues. Recent research found fewer than 
half of the women aged under 44 surveyed who had experienced menopause symptoms 
discussed these symptoms with their doctor.51   |  Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 70  |  Health  
There has been a significant and positive increase in public discourse on the impacts of 
menopause symptoms on Australian women and the need for greater support to increase 
health professional capability to help women manage their menopause symptoms. Recent 
research highlights the need for general practitioners to be able to provide responsive 
menopause management, including the need to assess all women at midlife for increased 
risks of chronic disease, such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease .52  
Budget highlights: Support for menopause trai ning  
The Government will provide $1.2  million over two years from 2024 –25 to support 
training for health practitioners to better treat, care and manage women’s health 
during menopause. This measure will make it easier for health practitioners to access 
training so that they can provide well -informed, up -to-date advice and treatment to 
women during menopause .  
 
Maternal health  
Australia is regarded as a safe country in which to have a baby and compares well on 
several accepted measures of safety and quality  care. However, as for all systems of 
healthcare and service delivery, there are areas for continued improvement. Across the 
country there are differences in women’s access to services, their choice of care, and the 
provision of culturally appropriate care  that ensures women are always treated with 
respect and dignity.  
Improved model of care choice for pregnant women  
Antenatal care is care provided to a pregnant woman by a midwife or doctor to assess and 
improve the wellbeing of the mother and baby through out pregnancy. In 2021, 80  per cent 
of women who gave birth accessed antenatal care in the first trimester of their pregnancy, 
and 96  per cent of first -time mothers had five or more antenatal care visits.53 Regular 
antenatal care in the first trimester is associated with better maternal health in pregnancy, 
fewer interventions in late pregnancy and positive child health outcomes.  Women's Budget Statement   |   
 
Health   |  Page 71 
Budget highlights: Participating midwives package  
The Government has committed $56.5  million over four  years from 2024 –25 to 
prom ote high -quality and tailored maternity care, by implementing 
recommendations from the MBS Review Taskforce for participating midwives. 
This  package will:  
• ensure women receive high -quality care by increasing the time for antenatal and 
postnatal attendance items so that they appropriately reflect the time care takes  
• ensure women receive best practice clinical care by introducing a birth debrief 
and mental health screening at the six -week postnatal attendance  
• support continuity of care by ensuring women can continue to receive care from 
their participating midwife when being admitted to hospital.  
 
Box 9: Enabling eligible nurse practitioners and midwives to prescribe 
PBS medicines  
The Government has committed to removing the legislated requirement for an 
eligible nurse practitioner or eligible midwife to collaborate with a medical 
practitioner in order to prescribe PBS medicines. This arrangement will allow 
eligible midwives or nurse practitioners to prescribe PBS medicines or provide 
services under Medicare, removing barriers to primary care for Australians, 
particularly in rural and remote areas. It will support more effective use of the 
existing health workforce by recognising that nurse practitioners and midwives are 
autonomous professionals who can deliver high -quality care to patients within their 
scope of practice.  
 
Supporting women experiencing pregnancy loss  
Miscarriage can be a traumatic experience for women and can have lasting impacts on their 
physical and mental health.  Women who have experienced miscarriage commonly report a 
lack of information, poor access to follow -up care and limited referral to support services.  
Miscarriage Australia estimates that around 285 miscarriages occur every day in Australia, 
which amounts to one in four pregnancies.54 However, statistics on miscarriage are not 
collected in Australia so it is difficult to know exactly how frequently it occurs, particularly 
as it may occur when a woman is not aware she is pregnant.  
There can be significant stigma, shame and guilt linked to miscarriage, and access to 
appropriate support services is important to enable women and families to process their 
grief and associated impacts. The Government is pro viding increased support for families   |  Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 72  |  Health  
experiencing miscarriage to ensure that bereaved women and families can access support at 
a time when they are at most risk of isolation and distress.  
Budget highlights: Support for women experiencing miscarriage  
The G overnment is providing $ 7.0 million over four years from 2024 –25 to support 
the development of miscarriage education and awareness materials and provide 
funding for bereavement care services for women and families experiencing 
miscarriage.  
 
Gender analys is in practice: Miscarriage awareness program and data 
collection  
The Government is improving healthcare for women who have experienced 
miscarriage through delivering a public education and awareness program and 
building the evidence base on the impact of miscarriage.  
Miscarriage is, sadly, a common complication of early pregnancy, yet too often it is 
shrouded in silence and shame. It is estimated that up to 110,000 women experience 
miscarriage annually in Australi a.55 Furthermore, 1–2 per cent of women wi ll 
experience three or more consecutive miscarriages.56 The experience of miscarriage 
can be extremely distressing and can lead to anxiety, depression, or post -traumatic 
stress disorder for some women. There is also a lack of rigorous data collection on 
miscarriage, while gender bias in the healthcare  system and a lack of targeted 
services mean that many women are not receiving adequate care during and after 
miscarriage.  
Delivering a public education program will help start a public conversation about 
misca rriage and better support women and their families to process this loss and 
grief. The program will also educate health professionals to provide more sensitive 
support for women and families experiencing miscarriage and early pregnancy loss. 
It will also h ave an indirect impact on the partners and families of women who have 
experienced miscarriage.  
A data scoping study on a national data collection on miscarriage will contribute to 
the development of evidence -based policies and programs, which will have po sitive 
impacts for women who experience miscarriage.  
 
Australia is one of the safest places in the world for a baby to be born, yet death occurring 
within the perinatal period (from 20  weeks of gestation to 28  days after birth) is sadly more 
common than it should be. In 2021, there were 3,016 perinatal deaths (1  per cent of babies 
born).57 Of these deaths, just over three -quarters (76  per cent) were stillbirths and 
24 per cent were neonatal deaths.58 Spontaneous preterm labour or rupture of membranes  Women's Budget Statement   |   
 
Health   |  Page 73 
was the most common cause of neonatal deaths. The Government is committed to 
continuing services that reduce the rates of pre -term births in Australia.  
There is increasing evidence that some stillbirths are preventable. Some countries – 
including the Unit ed Kingdom, Northern Ireland and New Zealand – have successfully 
reduced stillbirth rates. The Government is working to reduce stillbirth through the 
National Stillbirth Action and Implementation Plan 2020 –2030.  
Budget highlights: Support for preterm birth and stillbirth  
• The Government is providing $ 5.8 million over two years from 2024 –25 to 
continue strategies to prevent preterm and early -term birth and reduce the 
number of babies born too early in participating  maternity services and 
First  Nations communities.  
• The Government is committing $0.9  million over two years from 2024 –25 to 
continue to monitor and evaluate activities under the National Stillbirth Action and 
Implementation Plan 2020 –2030 . This will help measure Australia’s success in 
meeting stillbirth reduction targets since the Stillbirth Action Plan’s publication 
in December  2020.  
 
Safe births on Country for First  Nations women   
The Government is improving antenatal care for First  Nations women by providing 
First  Nations communities with access to culturally appropriate midwifery and continuity 
of care models such as ‘Birthing on Country’.  
The Birthing on Country model of care includes access to professional indemnity insurance 
for privately practis ing midwives. This means midwives can continue to work to their full 
scope of practice and First  Nations women have the choice to seek care outside of a hospital 
setting, and with their choice of midwife. It also means that all women who choose to have 
a low-risk homebirth or intrapartum care outside a hospital with a midwife can do so 
knowing professional indemnity insurance would be available in case of an adverse event.  
Budget highlights: Safeguarding the Birthing on Country model of care  
The Government  has committed $3. 5 million over four  years from 202 4–25 (and 
$0.4 million per  year ongoing)  to expand the Midwife Professional Indemnity 
Scheme. The expansion will support improved health outcomes for First  Nations 
women and babies by enabling Birthing on Country programs to engage midwives 
who can provide culturally safe, continuous midwifery care.  
   |  Women's Budget Statement

Mental health  
Mental health, and access to care, is impacted  by a range of social and economic inequities 
which are disproportionately experienced by women.  Socioeconomic risks for mental ill 
health in women include lower income , poorer job conditions and insecure work , primary 
carer responsibilities, and physical and sexual violence.59 Critical points in the li fe of 
women and girls, such as puberty, pregnancy, motherhood and menopause can also 
influence mental health  and have flow -on effects for families and children.  
The Australian Bureau of Statistics found that in 2020 –2022, one in four women 
(24.6  per cent) had a mental health disorder in the previous 12  months, compared with 
almost one in five men (18.3  per cent).60 Transgender and gender diverse Australians had 
higher rates of  12-month mental  health  disorders  than cisgender Australians (33.1  per cent 
compar ed with 21.3  per cent). In 2020 –2022, women with a 12 -month mental health 
disorder were more likely to have seen a health professional for their mental health than 
men (51.1  per cent compared to 36.4  per cent).   
  Women's Budget Statement   |   
 
Health   |  Page 75 
Budget highlights: Expanding mental health services  
The Government is providing $ 888.1 million over eight years from 2024 –25 to 
expand  the range of free mental health services available to all Australians, 
including women.  
To address the gap for people experiencing mild mental health symptoms, a new 
national, low -intensity digital service will be provided. From 1  January  2026, 
every  Aust ralian will be able to access this free service without a referral, providing 
them timely, high quality mental health support. Once fully established, 
150,000  people are expected to make use of this service each year.  
The Government is also improving  acces s to free mental health services through a 
network of walk -in Medicare Mental Health Centres , built on the established Head 
to Health network . The upgraded national network of 61 Medicare Mental Health 
Centres will be open by 30  June  2026.  
For people who h ave complex needs, the Government is providing funding for 
Primary Health Networks to work in partnerships with GPs to deliver 
multidisciplinary wraparound supports and care coordination .  
 Leadership, representation and decision -making   |  Page 77 Leadership, representation and 
decision -making  
Gender equality cannot be achieved without women’s meaningful participation in 
leadership and decision -making roles. When women take part i n decision -making 
processes, this can help to ensure institutions and systems that shape and deliver 
programs, policies and services not only better meet women’s needs, but also 
achieve better and more inclusive outcomes overall. Excluding women from 
leade rship and decision -making roles can create barriers to women’s access to 
resources and services.  
The Government is committed to addressing the barriers women face and improving 
women’s participation in leadership and decision -making roles, and women’s 
representation overall. In Working for Women: A Strategy for Gender Equality (Working 
for Women ), the Government has committed to driving action to increase women’s 
representation across all levels of political, public service and non -government 
leadership and  decision -making.  
Inclusive and diverse leadership creates better outcomes in a number of ways. 
Gender diversity benefits organisations and decision -making bodies when they can 
draw upon the widest and best pool of leaders. Research shows that companies wi th 
more women on their boards outperform those without and organisations with 
greater gender diversity among senior leaders are more profitable.  
This chapter provides a snapshot of women’s leadership in Australia in the public 
and private sectors. It also outlines actions the Government is taking to improve 
women’s participation in leadership and decision -making roles, and women’s 
participation in sport, which will help to change gender stereotypes.

Women in leadership and decision -making  
The Government is committed to promoting gender equality and supporting women’s 
leadership in every aspect of Australian life, from corporate boards to community 
leadership to parliaments across Australia. This includes ensuring diverse women are 
represented in visible and influential decision -making roles across all sectors and 
leadership levels. The Government must also set the standard by ensuring the diversity of 
the Australian community is represented in government decision -making.  
Women in le adership  
To achieve gender equality, more women, including First  Nations women, women with 
disability and women from diverse backgrounds, need to be represented in 
decision -making and leadership positions as well as in public life. Although women 
continue to remain under -represented in leadership roles across Australia, there has been 
some progress towards gender parity.  Women's Budget Statement   |   
 
Leadership, representation and decision -making   |  Page 79 
In 2023, Australia’s world gender equality ranking in the World Economic Forum’s Gender 
Gap Report increased from 43rd to 26th.61 This was  largely due to the gains made in 
women’s representation in Parliament.  
Women held 53  per cent of all Senior Executive Service roles in the Australian Public 
Service (APS) in 2023 – an increase from 46  per cent in 2019.62 For the first time, women’s 
repres entation in the APS reached gender parity at the SES Band 2 level in 2023. This 
progress is a result of targeted gender equality strategies implemented within the APS to 
promote more women into senior leadership positions.  
The 2023 Chief Executive Women’s  Senior Executive Census found that women’s 
representation in private sector leadership roles has increased since 2022. However, change 
continues to be slow. In the top 300 ranked Australian companies (ASX 300), women held 
9 per cent of Chief Executive Off icer (CEO) positions in 2023, up from 6  per cent in 2022.63 
Women on boards  
As at 30  June  2023, women held 51.6  per cent of Australian Government board positions 
and 42.3  per cent of Chair and Deputy Chair positions on Australian Government boards.64 
These are the highest rates of representation since reporting began in the 2008 –09 financial 
year. However, only ten of the 17 portfolios reported at least 50  per cent representation of 
women overall in their Australian Government board positions. Without  further action, it 
could take at least six years to reach gender parity in Chair and Deputy Chair positions at 
the current rate.  
To accelerate progress in women’s representation in board positions and Chair and Deputy 
Chair positions, the Government intro duced new targets for women’s representation on 
Australian Government boards as part of Working for Women . The Government has also 
expanded reporting for gender balance on Australian Government boards to capture data 
on all positions for boards that meet t he reporting requirements. This will allow more 
comprehensive reporting against targets and provides an opportunity to drive further 
progress towards gender equality on Australian Government boards.    |  Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 80  |  Leadership, representation and decision -making  
Budget highlights: New targets for Government boards  
As p art of Working for Women , the Government is implementing new targets for 
women’s representation on Australian Government boards. The new targets are at 
the portfolio level:  
• 50 per cent representation of women on Australian Government boards  
• 50 per cent rep resentation of women in Chair and Deputy Chair positions  
The Government also renewed its commitment to targets for women to hold 
50 per cent of all Australian Government board positions and at least 40  per cent of 
positions on individual Australian Governm ent boards.  
 
The private sector has made gains in women’s representation on boards. The ASX  20, 
which comprises the top 20 Australian Securities Exchange listed companies, made history 
by achieving an aggregate 40  per cent of women on their respective boards. Across the 
ASX  300 in 2023 , women held  only 35.6  per cent of board positions and 11 companies had 
no women on their boards.65 
Including women’s voices and experiences in policy -making  
The Government will continue to listen to and respon d to the voices of women to create a 
better, gender equal Australia for everyone. When policy is informed by the voices and 
lived experiences of diverse people, this can help ensure that programs have more 
equitable outcomes and better meet people’s needs.  
To support implementation of Working for Women  the Government will redesign the 
existing Women’s Leadership and Development Program to create the Working for Women 
Program.  
  Women's Budget Statement   |   
 
Leadership, representation and decision -making   |  Page 81 
Budget highlights: Working for Women Program  
The Government has established the Working for Women Program to fund key 
partnerships to engage with women and the Australian community on gender 
equality, and further support the inclusion of women’s voices an d experiences in 
policy -making. This includes:  
• increased investment for a network of National Women’s Alliances to inform 
ongoing implementation of Working for Women  by providing evidence based, 
intersectional gender equality advice and civil society exper tise to Government. 
The National Women’s Alliances elevate the voices of First  Nations women, 
culturally and linguistically diverse and migrant and refugee women, women 
with disability and women living in regional, rural and remote areas. In addition, 
they  provide expertise on policy solutions for gender -based violence and 
women’s economic equality and leadership.  
• establishing a research partnership to help build the evidence base on what 
works to achieve gender equality, especially in relation to driving economic 
equality. This will also allow policymakers to hear directly from the Australian 
community, particularly  women about their priorities for achieving gender 
equality  to inform and support the development of public policy . 
The Working for Women Progr am will also support actions to drive progress across 
the Working for Women’s  priority areas.  
 
Gender analysis has been used to guide the development of programs under the Future 
Drought Fund to give voice to women’s needs and experiences in responses to drought and 
climate change.    |  Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 82  |  Leadership, representation and decision -making  
Gender analysis in practice: Future Drought Fund  
The design and del ivery of programs under the Future Drought Fund (FDF) aim to 
boost the representation of women in leadership roles and promote gender equality 
when building resilience to drought and other climate risks.  
The objectives of the FDF are to build social, econ omic and environmental resilience. 
Gender inequality limits the way women and girls, men and boys can respond to 
and manage change. This compounds the effects of drought and other climate 
change related events and plays a large part in the roles people hav e in preparation, 
response and recovery. These events can also increase the prevalence of 
gender -based violence.66 Consultation on the FDF found that lack of access to 
services such as mental health services are amplified in rural Australia. 
The agricultur al workforce is also heavily gender segregated with women’s 
participation at 30.1  per cent.67 
While women face disadvantage, they also have skills and experiences critical for 
building resilience to the effects of drought and climate change, such as innova tion, 
adaptation, caring for the environment and food security. Women need to be 
represented at all stages of preparation, response and recovery.  
The revised Future Drought Fund Communities program will identify women as a 
priority for investment through C ommunity Impact Grants, Small Network Grants 
and the Mentoring Initiative. Other FDF programs will maximise participation and 
leadership opportunities for women, encourage locally led co -design processes to 
consider the impact of gender equality on drought  resilience, and link with existing 
programs that build personal and community resilience, such as non -clinical mental 
health and family violence support. This recognises that the representation and 
leadership of women, and promotion of gender equality are  critical for building 
social resilience as part of the Government’s climate resilience agenda.  
 
Driving gender equality through government systems  
Australia’s gender responsive budgeting framework places gender equality at the centre of 
Government decision -making. Since the 2023 –24 MYEFO process, gender responsive 
budgeting tools have been applied across the Budget. This enables Government to make 
informed decisions on investment and resource allocation to address gender gaps and 
drive im provements for gender equality. The ongoing work to improve data and gender 
analysis capability across Government will ensure high -quality and comprehensive advice 
to inform decision -making over future budgets.  
The Government is also driving change through  procurement systems. As part of Working 
for Women , the Government announced it will introduce a new legislative requirement for 
businesses with 500 or more employees to commit to targets to improve gender equality in 
their workplaces. Compliance with the requirement will be necessary to access Australian Women's Budget Statement   |

Government procurement opportunities over a certain threshold. This will address a key 
recommendation from the 2021 review of the Workplace  Gender  Equality  Act 2012 . 
Budget highlights: Driving gender equality through procurement  
The Government will implement a voluntary Commonwealth Supplier Registration 
process through AusTender. Through the registration process  businesses will be able 
to self -nominate on AusTender a s women -owned and led businesses. This will give 
the Government the ability to measure and analyse women -owned and led 
businesses the Commonwealth is contracting with. Th is process  will help to identify 
relevant suppliers for Government, and will support d evelopment of future actions 
by building the evidence base on the experiences of women owned and led 
businesses navigating Government procurement processes.  
 
Partnering to advance equality for First  Nations women  
First  Nations women and girls are leading efforts to enhance gender equality. First  Nations 
women’s experiences of gender inequality intersects with the impact of racism and the 
ongoing effects of colonisation. The importance of ensuring First  Nations women’s voices 
in policy development and decis ion-making is widely understood. The Government is 
committed to elevating and empowering First  Nations women in leadership and 
decision -making roles. Through Working for Women , the Government will be guided by the 
key principle that efforts to drive gender  equality for First  Nations Australians must be led 
by First  Nations Australians.  
Box 10: Institute for First  Nations Gender Justice  
The Wiyi Yani U Thangani  Institute for First  Nations Gender Justice (the Institute) 
at the Australian National University w as launched on 19  March  2024 by 
Ms June  Oscar AO, the new Chair of the Institute and the outgoing Aboriginal and 
Torres  Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. The Government has provided 
$3.0 million over four years for the Institute to support  the legacy of the 
Wiyi  Yani  U Thangani (Women’s Voices)  Project. It is the first of its kind in the world 
and will bring together First  Nations researchers to develop and design initiatives to 
improve life outcomes for First  Nations women and girls. Resea rch will focus on a 
range of issues including health and wellbeing, family violence, housing, education, 
child removals, financial security and environmental conservation – elevating the 
voices of more than 2,300 First  Nations women and girls to drive effo rts to achieve 
gender  equality .

Improving women’s and girls’ representation and 
participation in sport  
The participation of women and girls in sport provides important health, social and 
economic benefits and drives gender equality.  
Women and girls still face significant challenges in playing and volunteering in sport that 
stem from socio -cultural factors such as caring responsibilities, experiences of harassment 
and lack of role models. There is a significant gender gap in sport participation . Only 
33.6 per cent of women aged 15 years and over participate in sport related activity once 
per week. This compares to 49.8  per cent of men.68 
The 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup showcased the popularity of women’s sport, with the 
Matildas semi -final breaking all  Australian TV broadcasting records. This success has 
promoted discussions on parity and equality for women across all aspects of sport. 
Australia will continue to demonstrate the excellence of women’s sport through the hosting 
the 2027 Netball World Cup, 2029 Women’s Rugby World Cup and Brisbane 2032 Olympic 
and Paralympic Games.  
The Government has committed funding to the Australian Sports Commission to drive 
sector wide change, including the development of a National Gender Equity in Sport 
Governance Pol icy. This policy is being developed in partnership with all states and 
territories, and will outline ways to increase the representation of women and gender 
diverse people in key governance positions.   
MYEFO highlights: Improving women’s participation and safety in sport  
The Government is providing $200 .0 million over four years from 2023 –24 for the 
Play Our Way program. This provides targeted grants for sporting infrastructure 
and facilities to support women and girls to engage and partic ipate in sports and 
physical activity. Funding will be provided through a competitive grant 
opportunity. Successful organisations will use the grants to provide safe, inclusive, 
quality and sustainable sporting facilities and initiatives for women and girl s. This 
funding will also help them to remain involved in sport and physical activity for life.  
To improve the safety of sport in Australia, the Government is investing more than 
$36.3  million from 2023 –24 to 2027 –28, to tackle abuse, bullying, discriminat ion and 
sexual misconduct. This funding will allow Sports Integrity Australia to enhance 
their existing capabilities, and to deliver new initiatives to improve safety in sport, 
with a focus on women and  girls.

Strengthening global leadership  
The Government is committed to being a global leader on gender equality. To this end, the 
Government is developing a new International Gender Equality Strategy to recognise 
gender equality as central to Australia’s foreign policy, international development, 
humanitarian action, trade, peace and security, and consular efforts. It will retain 
Australia’s existing focus on addressing sexual and gender -based violence, and advancing 
women’s voice and leadership, the Women, Peace, and Security agenda, and women’s 
economic equality.  
Australia is committed to meeting the target that 80  per cent of development investments 
are implemented in a way that effectively supports gender equality. In 20 22–23, 75  per cent 
of Australia’s development investments effectively addresse d gender equality. The 
Government implement ed a new requirement for development and humanitarian 
investments valued at $3 .0 million and above to have a gender equality objective. This 
requirement is driving an increase in our development expenditure on gen der equality. 
In 2022 –23, Australia invested $1.7  billion in development programs that targeted gender 
equality, up from $1.5  billion in 2021 –22.69 
Gender equality is a priority in Australia’s engagement in regional and multilateral fora, 
including the Asi a Pacific Economic Cooperation, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, 
Pacific Islands Forum, G20, and United Nations bodies, including  the Commission on the 
Status of Women, Human Rights Council, General Assembly and Security Council.  
The Government is c urrently supporting the re -election of Natasha Stott Despoja AO to the 
United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) 
for the term 2025 –28. Ms Stott Despoja was first elected to the Committee for the term 
2021 –24 and is the first Australian to serve on the Committee in almost 30 years, and only 
the second Australian to serve on the Committee.
